1697759347.0,Robinhood Assignment. What are my options ?,"
 So I had some credit spreads on spy expiring today. I sold 434 puts and bought 433 puts. 17 contracts so that is 1700 spy shares. 

The 434 puts was assigned for -737,800 dollars while the 433 puts that I bought was assigned for 736,100 dollars. The execution price for both these trades was 426.43. 

Given that, it wasn‚Äôt closed out, what are my options tmrw ? My understanding is that I will have -1700 shares. Is this correct ? and that if there is a green day tmrw, I might actually get out of this in profit while the losses would be very compounded if it is a red day tmrw ?

Or would it just cancel each other at open ?",wallstreetbets,"Robinhood Assignment. What are my options ?

3. This image shows a table of margins both year over year and quarter over quarter. You can clearly see the yoy was in the green for a long time but in 2023, took a sizable hit from all these rate hikes and price cuts.

My put tripled in value in one second and was immediately back to its initial value 10 seconds later. It seems pretty much every other stock experienced a significant dip at 9 am on the dot (most around 0.2% - 0.3%), but none were nearly as exaggerated as spy's drop (0.4%). After this quick drop and immediate rebound, my options chain (as well as the value of the contracts i was holding) basically broke for the next 5 minutes. The prices would update once every minute, the bid-ask spread was fucked, i couldn't sell, it was all fucked. 

Now i was using robinhood which is widely regarded as a regarded trading app, so this might have just been their shit systems. But if this phenomena happened to everyone else on all other brokers trading 0dte spy options, then that is pretty interesting. If this is a common event that occurred then what i guess happened is the algos basically broke after the market dropped so fast, and for like 5 minutes they weren't working properly. This would probably be isolated to just spy I would think because it is the only stock I could find that dropped so sharply, but if it was a more global phenomena that would be even cooler.

After this quick drop and immediate rebound, my options chain (as well as the value of the contracts i was holding) basically broke for the next 5 minutes. The prices would update once every minute, the bid-ask spread was fucked, i couldn't sell, it was all fucked. 

Now i was using robinhood which is widely regarded as a regarded trading app, so this might have just been their shit systems. But if this phenomena happened to everyone else on all other brokers trading 0dte spy options, then that is pretty interesting. If this is a common event that occurred then what i guess happened is the algos basically broke after the market dropped so fast, and for like 5 minutes they weren't working properly. This would probably be isolated to just spy I would think because it is the only stock I could find that dropped so sharply, but if it was a more global phenomena that would be even cooler.

this happen to anyone else?"

1697741519.0,"RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019, don't miss this boat 50+ by 2025","# My history on $TSLA

When tesla first launched the model 3, seeing in person reservations line throughout the mall, I started really looking into Tesla stock, fast forward to 2019, I went all in (and made this reddit account: TSLA4LIFE1), I sold some pre-COVID rally and model 3, but quickly re-bought during the downturn, and then sold some after first split to put it into WSB's favourite stock of 2021.

# Current problems with TSLA

Coming to today, I'm starting to see lots of similarity in $RIVN both on the numbers and valuation side, and also on the products, innovation, feedback, and demand side. There is no doubt $TSLA has been struggling and just offering price cuts to justify selling basically the same model 3 from 2018 in 2023. What was way ahead of the competition in 2018, is now barely on par, thus needing price cuts to justify the purchase.

# RIVN Demand

Rivian on the other hand, cant produce enough of their first vehicle - R1T, let alone the crazy demand, wait, and hype for the full sized SUV - R1S. Their products consistently get good reviews, have great quality, and are like nothing on the market.

Rivians are not only praised as top of the line tech, but also praised as amazing vehicles by Car enthusiasts, which is something Tesla always lacked.

&#x200B;

# RIVN Stock

So we have shown above that RIVN is a good company with good products, but is it a good stock? A good stock is a good company at a GOOD price.

&#x200B;

$Rivn was hit heavily with their recent news of offering $1.5 Billion of converting debt, which is maturing 2030. The stock is since down massively due to people thinking this was out of the blue, but as previously communicated this was expected sometime in 2024.

&#x200B;

Looking into the above I wanted to take a look at how RIVN was currently valued compared to TSLA:

[RIVN vs TSLA P\/S ratio](https://preview.redd.it/2p7ol800h7vb1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b863bd29d2d37c264486bacdfe07a85d078749a)

&#x200B;

For pre income and heavy growth companies (RIVN today and 2019 TSLA) it always makes sense to use P/S ratio (MKT Cap/Revenue), and as seen above, from this metric currently the market has a 50% discount on RIVN compared to TSLA.

&#x200B;

# Cash on hand

&#x200B;

[RIVN vs TSLA Cash on hand](https://preview.redd.it/qwax3jl0h7vb1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=67f9f20bf65a371b243174fc494b2382e482dd7e)

&#x200B;

RIVN has a MKT cap of $**16.512B** and cash on hand of $10.2B, compared to TSLA's MKT cap of $**692.374B** and cash on hand of $23B, so a 42x bigger MKT cap, but only 2x the cash on hand. This eliminates fear of further needing to raise cash for a while, and further strengthens RIVN's valuation vs TSLA.

&#x200B;

# Revenue growth vs. margin growth

Rivn is growing revenues faster than tesla, while their COGS is going up less than Tesla, now what does this mean? -> Better margins. Although still negative for RIVN, they are on the right track, and even as ELON keeps blaming the current macro environment, RIVN is dealing with the same macro, yet somehow increasing their top and bottom lines at a better pace then TSLA

&#x200B;

# Price targets and how long to hold

Now RIVN still has a long way to go, and I'm not trying to justify nor buying RIVN for the long term. I see the stock at a discount currently, but also realize it has room to fall back to mid teens. However, on the upside, I can see a massive run of 50+ before 2025, which is what my target is.

Many people got married to Tesla, which went from a good to great company, while the stock went from attractive, to extremely overvalued. Yet, many initial investors fell into the trap on not realizing that great companies as shit prices are shit stocks.

&#x200B;

I will keep increasing my position on the way down, and start legging out profits at $50+

1697702800.0,Powell Speech Will Be Non-Event,"Powell is speaking at 12 PM EST on Thursday. Next week is FOMC quiet week (No Fed speak), so Powell will be prepping the market for what they plan to do in Nov. All Fed officials who have talked, including the most hawkish ones like Logan and Waller, pointed to a pause in Nov to observe the data. Market will be looking for any comments related to the run up in 10 year rate over the last few months. The Fed is concerned about the 10 year rate run up causing a financial accident(and forcing them to do QE like UK did late 2022), so Powell will probably say that the 10 year rate is doing the Fed's job for him. This will be clue for stabilization of the 10 year rate and potential market rally. Powell will also leave the Fed the option for a December rate hike by pointing out the recent strong data. 

There's no more econ data except for GDP (which we already know will prob be strong) and PCE (which would probably be similar to CPI). I anticipate market will slightly hedge/sell off slightly before the speech, and then rally until next week ahead of the big tech earnings. I'll be watching to see if SP500 hold the 4300 levels, and ready to buy on weakness to ride the rally. Mid Oct is also favorable for seasonal year-end rally so I'm leaning towards buying dips as opposed to selling rally. For those who are positioning bearish for tomorrow, what kind of bomb do you think Powell will drop in his speech?",wallstreetbets,"Powell Speech Will Be Non-Event Powell is speaking at 12 PM EST on Thursday.

1697698382.0,"My Israel-Hamas conflict play: $PBR ""Hey dummy, you're looking at the wrong continent.""","$PBR is the largest producer of oil in south america with refineries all over Venezula and Brazil.

How does this South American oil company stand to gain from the growing conflict in the Middle East?

First a little lesson on international trade and logistics:

The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. It's an essential passage for international oil tankers, making it a critical point for global energy supplies, especially for oil to the US. 

And it just so happens that Iran holds significant influence over the Strait of Hormuz and has the capability to disrupt or temporarily block the passage of ships through this crucial waterway.

...and it just so happens that is exactly what they are planning to do in response to Israel's continued retaliation into Gaza.

Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/business/israel-oil-embargo-markets.html



If the Strait of Hormuz route is disrupted by Iran the US would have no choice but to increase oil exports from South America including Venezuela and Brazil. This week, the US already eased sanctions on Venezula. Most likely as a pre-emptive backup plan if oil from Middle East gets disrupted.

Source: https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-venezuela-announce-oil-sanctions-deal-tuesday-report-2023-10-16/

While its true you can play any of the big oil names, PBR stands to benefit the most as opposed BP, XOM, or CVX from Iran's involvement in this conflict.

The unequivocally smart way to play this is with shares. The uncertainty between the timeline and even if the embargo will take place makes this a very risky play. But I'm a degenerate, so options it is. I have positions in both January and July 2024 $20 calls.

One last thing, if you're buying now, you're basically buying at 52 week highs. Which is generally not a wise thing to do.

1697679477.0,When is nissan going to announce their ev pickup?,"So it's going to happen, and we all know what happens when an automaker announces an ev pickup.

The reason I suspect it's soon is because just a few weeks ago Nissan announced they'd be discontinuing the titan and retooling the factory for EVs in 2024. Nissan isn't rolling in cash like the other automakers, they started getting kicked hard before covid, kept getting kicked during covid, and never popped back up. 

So they're not going to retool any more than they have to, they've been making ev pickups in Asia, and trucks make the money in the states.

Is it going to be announced at Chicago in February next year, new York in March, or Detroit in September? 

Could be an option for 12 month or 18 month LEAPs depending on the answer.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1ahLb

https://i.imgur.com/t401jcd.png

Technically since the Fed can fabricate money infinitely, it can't actually go bankrupt.  But it will signal to the world the extent to which Fed is losing control of the dollar's value.

Additionally, with QT around $1.1T a year and massive deficits projected to be $2.0T a year for the next decade, the bond market will be flooded with an insurmountable supply ($3.1T/yr) of Treasuries.  Who will buy all these bonds when we are struggling to absorb even today's supply?   More printing and QE is the only way out.

*What to buy then?  Stonks, gold, internet money, or signed Taylor Swift memorabilia??? Your guess is as good as mine.*

Edit: I simplified a few things for the average reader but no QT ""rolling off debt"" is not any better than selling bonds.  Don't be gaslit by this pseudo intelligent sounding verbal diarrhea, it's the exact same thing functionally and Treasury must still rollover existing debt + issue more each year.  Fed is still printing money currently with the floor system through lush interest payments via RRP and IORB.  **Moreover they will have to print even more to absorb absolutely massive incoming supply of Treasuries.

Additionally, with QT around $1.1T a year and massive deficits projected to be $2.0T a year for the next decade, the bond market will be flooded with an insurmountable supply ($3.1T/yr) of Treasuries.  Who will buy all these bonds when we are struggling to absorb even today's supply?   More printing and QE is the only way out.

*What to buy then?  Stonks, gold, internet money, or signed Taylor Swift memorabilia??? Your guess is as good as mine.*

Edit: I simplified a few things for the average reader but no QT ""rolling off debt"" is not any better than selling bonds.  Don't be gaslit by this pseudo intelligent sounding verbal diarrhea, it's the exact same thing functionally and Treasury must still rollover existing debt + issue more each year.  Fed is still printing money currently with the floor system through lush interest payments via RRP and IORB.  **Moreover they will have to print even more to absorb absolutely massive incoming supply of Treasuries.  At the current trajectory our version of YCC is not out of the question.**"

1697573256.0,Friend is ALL IN on DWAC,"Hey all,

My friend has zero investment experience but he keeps raving about this DWAC stock and how TMTG is going to rival all the media giants. He opened a brokerage account for the sole purpose of DWAC and this is the only stock he's ever purchased. Recently, he found out he had a $3k lien on his condo for 6+ months of unpaid HOA fees so he had to go get a personal loan. Instead of taking out only $3k, he took out $27k over 7 years (rate north of 7 percent). After paying his HOA dues he put the rest of this loan into DWAC as this is going to ""make him a millionaire"".

I keep trying to tell my friend how foolish this is as $27k is more than half of his yearly after tax take home income but he refuses to listen. He won't do any due diligence on DWAC as his belief in this stock is stronger than any technical guidance currently available. I've literally done 10x the due diligence he has in an attempt to persuade him to be more wise but he only accuses me of gaslighting him into FUDing out. He says he doesn't want to live with regret so he's YOLOing, but I feel like he is overlooking the future regret that may come with a post-merger collapse or liquidation.

So.. what do you guys think? Is my friend as naive as I seem to think? Or are these aspects to this merger that I'm overlooking?

1697563673.0,ChargePoint becomes a good risk/reward and is still way over-shorted,"So long story short, ChargePoint is a leader in manufacturing and selling charging stations for EVs, but where they make real money is by charging for a subscription to their Charging Point Operator software to manage the stations and get paid when people go there.

It's really popular among businesses to get more people arround (the station pops up on the mobile apps so EV drivers find them) but also as a revenue stream (a CPO can get a 50% profit margin on the electricity they sell easily).

They have A TON of stations around the world and their quarterly revenue is $150 million, of which $30 million are subscriptions.

But here's the deal: they are aggressively trying to outpace competitors which leads to still losing big money. The CEO has been saying that they expect a profit end of 2024, and says they're on track.

So, in this economy, obviously they have taken a big hit as a not yet profitable business. However, they have again secured $300 millions more in funding last week (quite easily with historic investors), saying that's the last dilution before profitability in 2024.

Sooo after this economy + dilutions, the price has plummeted from $19.25 in 2022 to $3.5 today, obviously in this time it was common sense to short them and lots of people did, reaching $803 million in shares (23.7%) sold short in September 2022.

Now these short positions are in a big profit, and having plummeted 80% of its market cap the company is now quite affordable but there is no chance they go under with the new capital they still have on hands. I suspect the first short sellers are closing their positions, resulting in a +4% today.

However, some new shorts have been recorded probably due to the new dilution that already happened. I believe these new shorts **are dumb as fuck**, its the equivalent of regards buying calls *after* a stock jumped 80%, it's ridiculous, with their revenue there is no way CHPT goes much lower than that, however **THE SHORT INTEREST IS STILL AT 26.8%**. So very soon, I expect the short sellers trying to outrun each other tu close their positions. The ones who are in a big profit have everything to lose.



TL;DR: CHPT has droped so far that it bacame a positive risk/reward for buyers and **VERY** risky for shorts, that are still at 26.8% of the float considering that it's a bet the company goes under, which it won't with all its new cash from last week + with its massive revenues and leadership position, it would even be bought out for more than that by an energy company anyway.",wallstreetbets,"ChargePoint becomes a good risk/reward and is still way over-shorted So long story short, ChargePoint is a leader in manufacturing and selling charging stations for EVs, but where they make real money is by charging for a subscription to their Charging Point Operator software to manage the stations and get paid when people go there.

1697554503.0,Buy PENN calls for late November for massive gain YOLO,"Penn Gaming will release new branded ESPN Bets sports betting app in November.  ESPN will make a massive marketing push.  The stock sold off during the news that they'd sell Barstool for $0 back to Dave Portnoy to make room for the ESPN partnership. But now it's very oversold.  Currently branded Barstool, Penn has 4% market share of the sports betting app industry.  If that merely doubled to 8%, that's a huge catalyst for the stock price, which is undervalued by any metric.  The book value per share alone is $28.24.  Unlike their apps-only competitors (Draft Kings & FanDuel), the app could completely fail and this business is still undervalued.  Because first and foremost, this is a casino company which operates 43 casinos and has a P/E ratio of only 4.67.   By late November, this stock could be at least $25 per share (up over 20% from current $20.8).  I recommend buying November calls with $24 or $25 strike price for low-risk / high reward returns.  Or just go long the stock, which is bound to recover eventually (even if my timing prediction is wrong).  Also, there has been insider buying at prices below $24 per share.

 While what is now an all-out war on naked short sellers intensifies,  there is a new flashpoint on the front line‚Äìa potentially devastating  ruling targeting those who are alleged to make illegal naked short  selling possible: **The Facilitators: bankers and brokers.**¬† 

On September 29, Federal District Court Judge Lorna Schofield of  the Southern District of New York issued a ruling that has the potential  to significantly disrupt Wall Street compliance, and is a major first  step towards protecting retail investors from fraud.¬†

In ***Harrington Global Opportunity Fund Ltd. v. CIBC World Markets, Inc et.al,***  Judge Schofield found that broker-dealers may be primarily liable for  manipulative trading initiated by their customers because they serve as  ‚Äúgate-keepers‚Äù of trading on securities exchanges.¬†

These broker-dealers have a ‚Äúcontinuing responsibility to  ensure that their customer‚Äôs order flow ... is in compliance with all  applicable rules, regulations and laws and detect and prevent  manipulative or fraudulent trading ‚Ä¶ under the supervision and control  of the firm,‚Äù the judge ruled.¬†

The defendants in the case had motioned to dismiss Harrington‚Äôs claims of market manipulation and spoofing (when **traders**  place market orders and then cancel them before the order is ever  fulfilled, manipulating prices in the meantime). Judge Schofield denied  the motion after hearing arguments that broker-dealers are not  responsible for ‚Äútheir customers‚Äô trading‚Äù.¬†

Instead, the ruling  recognizes that not only are broker-dealers the gate-keepers who can  enable illegal naked short selling, but they are responsible, and thus  liable for their customers‚Äô actions. Schofield described broker-dealers  as ‚Äúreckless in not knowing that the trades being executed at their  customers‚Äô direction were manipulative‚Äù.¬†",wallstreetbets,"Is This The End Of Naked Short Selling?

1697490950.0,Implied volatility straddles for earnings,"Hi!

Just a quick question, does anyone play straddles for earnings to benefit from the rise in implied volatility?

I'm trying to find a good strategy for trading earnings. Been researching straddles a bit recently and using an options calculator, but I can't seem to justify the risk of them without an increase in IV, which only (reliably) occurs prior to earnings. Hopefully some of you can tell me if it's a good strategy? :)

Example:

10-day IV average chart, can see that it's starting to rise ahead of earnings.

Options calculator results below. Assumed 50% rise in IV leading up to earnings - based on 0.6/0.4 (from above)

Can see from the above that I could make $100+ if IV rose as expected prior to earnings with the straddle protecting me from movement in the share price. Not aiming to hold after earnings due to IV crush.

This industry is Uranium!

Current Market Environment:
I don‚Äôt have any conviction in whether the market will move in a certain direction. With negative global sentiment (Isreal-Palestine tensions) and (Ukriane-Russia conflict) I truly don‚Äôt know what to expect from this market. As of today, October 15, 2023, there will be some big names (TSLA, BAC, NFLX) announcing earnings next week. This could shift sentiment as well but as of right now, I don‚Äôt have an opinion on this. One other thing to note is that the futures market is predicting that the next Fed meeting will likely result in the interest rate remaining unchanged at 94% probability. I think with better-than-expected earnings, and positive speeches from J.Powell and other Fed members we could see a small move up but only time will tell. The current market environment remains choppy at best!

Uranium Breakout Setups:
As of right now, I am seeing 4 main tickers emerging within the uranium industry. They are‚Ä¶
1. LEU 
2. UEC 
4. EU 

The reason these 4, to me, have potential is for a few reasons‚Ä¶
- Significant 1st leg up moves with $EU moving 30%, $UEC moving 60%, and $LEU moving 70%, before there current consolidation period
- They all have high Average Daily Range Percentages (ADR%) with the lowest one being from $EU which has a 5.5% ADR
- Tight ranges/ consolidation periods - Every one of these names has a pullback and continues to form a tight range

Other names in the industry such as UUUU, CCJ, NXE, DNN, UROY are either too choppy for my liking or they have fallen out of trend at the time of posting.

It‚Äôs interesting to note, that the price of Uranium ($UX - Uranium Futures) had large price increases right before these setups occurred. We currently have just seen uranium prices shoot up again while also hitting decade-long highs.

With respect to fundamentals, I don‚Äôt think I have the knowledge to really talk about the supply and demand components of uranium. That said, I have seen a handful of analysts express interest in the uranium sector.

Conclusion:
In summary, if you are a trend-following trader, uranium names should be on your watchlist! They may need a few more days of consolidation but they could move at any time. If however, a handful of names start breaking down, I will be more cautious on trading the uranium theme.

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/18/where-will-palantir-technologies-stock-be-in-5-yea/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/18/where-will-palantir-technologies-stock-be-in-5-yea/)

NICE EXCERPT:

""What's more, analysts are anticipating¬†the company's earnings to almost quadruple in 2023 to $0.23 per share from $0.06 per share last year.

Palantir's robust growth can be attributed to its growing customer base and a jump in customer spending. It ended the second quarter of 2023 with¬†421 customers, a nice jump of 38% over the year-ago period. More importantly, Palantir's billings increased at a faster pace of 52% during the quarter to $603 million.

This spike in billings is an indication that Palantir is signing more customer contracts, as this metric usually refers¬†to the annual amount billed by a [SaaS](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/) (software-as-a-service) company to its customers. So the robust jump in Palantir's billings points toward a stronger revenue pipeline.

One of the reasons why Palantir's billings have jumped so nicely is because of an increase in spending by existing customers.¬†This is evident from Palantir's net dollar retention rate of 110%.""

 ""All this indicates that Palantir could indeed hit $5 billion in revenue by 2025, as Wedbush estimates. Even better, analysts are expecting the company's bottom line to increase at a CAGR of 82%¬†for the next five years. Based on Palantir's 2022 earnings of $0.06 per share, its bottom line could jump to $1.20 per share by the end of 2027.

GREAT ARTICLE FROM MOTLEY FOOL TODAY: 10-18-23

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/18/where-will-palantir-technologies-stock-be-in-5-yea/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/10/18/where-will-palantir-technologies-stock-be-in-5-yea/)

NICE EXCERPT:

""What's more, analysts are anticipating¬†the company's earnings to almost quadruple in 2023 to $0.23 per share from $0.06 per share last year.

Palantir's robust growth can be attributed to its growing customer base and a jump in customer spending. It ended the second quarter of 2023 with¬†421 customers, a nice jump of 38% over the year-ago period. More importantly, Palantir's billings increased at a faster pace of 52% during the quarter to $603 million.

This spike in billings is an indication that Palantir is signing more customer contracts, as this metric usually refers¬†to the annual amount billed by a [SaaS](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/) (software-as-a-service) company to its customers. So the robust jump in Palantir's billings points toward a stronger revenue pipeline.

One of the reasons why Palantir's billings have jumped so nicely is because of an increase in spending by existing customers.¬†This is evident from Palantir's net dollar retention rate of 110%.""

 ""All this indicates that Palantir could indeed hit $5 billion in revenue by 2025, as Wedbush estimates. Even better, analysts are expecting the company's bottom line to increase at a CAGR of 82%¬†for the next five years. Based on Palantir's 2022 earnings of $0.06 per share, its bottom line could jump to $1.20 per share by the end of 2027. """

1697456428.0,Warren Buffett quotes (The World's greatest Investor),"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently.

We simply attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.

Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.

When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact.

The only way to get love is to be lovable. It's very irritating if you have a lot of money. You'd like to think you could write a check: 'I'll buy a million dollars' worth of love.' But it doesn't work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get.

Basically, when you get to my age, you'll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you.

You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.

Wall Street is the only place that people ride to in a Rolls Royce to get advice from those who take the subway.

There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.

1697433716.0,TSLA Market Profile Recap and Look Ahead,"Hey all, I wanted to post my observations on TSLA after Friday's session from a Market Profile standpoint. If you didn't catch my post recapping the Thursday 10/12 session, you can [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/176qmfx/market_profile_analysis_on_tsla_going_into/).

From Thursday and previous sessions, we established a bearish outlook based on the TPO and Volume Profile charts. Friday's session acts as confirmation of that outlook.

The most significant indication of this is the change in interest at 258.9 from Thursday to Friday's session. On Thursday, 258.9 acted as a secondary point of control, as it was the peak of that lower distribution. This means that in that auction range, there was the most interest by both buyers and seller to trade at 258.9.

This sentiment changed as we quickly moved down from this price after the open and never traded back up. We also see acceptance at the lows, as that's where we spent most of our time trading.

We have a poor low and unlike the poor high from Thursday I expect this low to be revisited and broken pretty quickly. The reason being is because we lingered near the low for most of the day, as demonstrated by the value area encompassing the low.  This concept of breaking the poor high/low is called repair as it repairs the structure of the poor low that lacked symmetry without a proper ‚Äúbottom‚Äù.

I would also like to note that while I do not show the volume profile in my screenshot, I do find it important in accordance with the TPO chart. With TSLA over the last few days, the VP chart has been pretty consistent with the TPO structure, which just adds additional confidence to my thoughts.

Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions about this please let me know!

1697413177.0,Snapchat (SNAP) Undervalued?,"Snapchat has fallen significantly from its ATH of $83 in Sept 2021 to $8.7 in Oct 2023 without any significant bounce.  
I believe the stock is unfairly valued, especially for the long term. Let's look at why.

  
The Good.  
\- If you are a Snapchat user you know how sticky the platform can be. A lot of your memories, clips, and key moments are stored directly on Snapchats servers. This greatly reduces the chances of people switching the app altogether. Another observation of this that I've increasingly noticed around me is that people open the Snapchat app by default as a camera. This along with its streak concept, keeps people hooked and unwilling to get rid of the app especially if they have a group of friends on them too. And new users every year will only create a snowball effect.

\- Instagram, Snaps biggest competitor has slowly evolved into a very commercial product where people mindlessly scroll through random content. The edge that Snapchat has here is that it has a far more personal experience among its users. 

\- Continuous innovation is also another huge plus in my book as they are very quick to adapt and introduce new features in their platform, such as the AI bot, which it adapted very quickly upon chatgpts release. Plus they have been working on VR and AR for a long time, and are very good at it too. Hence we can comfortably say they are continuously innovating and the future could be very bright for them.

\- The price for Snapchat if you believe in it long term is very attractive at these prices. These low prices have not been seen since Feb of 2019. And the platform has significantly matured since then. 

\- Increasing revenue.

\- Great risk to reward ratio for long term investors, and for short term investors a swing trade to $25 is likely. 

The Bad.  
\- They haven't been making a profit and having a hard time monetizing their platform. But I think this problem will sooner or later be resolved.

\- There may still be room for the stock to fall. Even though the price looks like it has found a floor, the ATL is still -40% away from the current price.

3.  **Consistent Dividend Payments**: Timken has maintained a consistent dividend payout over the years, with regular quarterly increasing sustainable dividends. 
4. **Analyst Ratings:** The stock has received positive ratings from analysts, with a high price target of $105.00 and an average price prediction of $89.44. Some forecasts even suggest the stock price will reach an average of $92.89 next year‚Äã.

With Mia's advice in mind, i decided to separate my love for history from my investment strategies. I started focusing on contemporary market trends, using reliable data and expert opinions. Gradually, my losses  diminished, and my portfolio began to recover.

But I know it‚Äôs against my gladiator instincts and I know that Julius Caesar will be disappointed if i continue to use weak strategies and not my gladiator instincts to make money. Which is exactly why I will be no longer using my friends advice and I will continue to use the destiny that I was given, and eventually rebuild the Roman Empire as a whole."

1697395449.0,How can I find the consumption of products of a company by country? Mondelez Inc x Nestle SA.,"I‚Äôm trying to find out the consumption of products by Mondelez Inc x Nestle SA around the globe.

Here is why:

Lots of Brazilians are now boycotting products by Mondelez Inc since a big left wing influencer has become the face of their product called Bis. 

In the past years, this influencer has been chasing all brands that sponsored right wings points of view and telling his followers to not buy from those companies. Things have escalated that even two politics from the left party have posted photos with Bis ‚Äî this is not a joke, but what a circus, right? ‚Äî to confront the #bisnuncamais (bisneveragain) hashtag that have organically emerged and been on Brazil trending topics of X (former Twitter) for the past three days, reaching nearly 250k mentions in one of those days. Now, people started to dive deep and target all products from Mondelez Inc. There‚Äôs even payless publicity by other influencers and regulars of its direct competition ‚Äî KitKat by Nestle. 

Even Mondelez Brazil has shared a note stating that it does not support any political side but all points of views and that the influencer was chosen because of his range on games and entertainment.

Even tho the movement of love Bis started too, it hasn‚Äôt reached any substantial numbers yet. And still, it might be easier to not buy a product or buy from the competition than to keep on buying to hype the sales, right? Specially because, statistically, in Brazil, the majority of people with more money support the right wing and the opposite applies as well.

I‚Äôm here because in the past week, Mondelez Inc shares dropped a bit and some people are associating this to the Bis product. How likely is that? I‚Äôm not an expert at all, but, I doubt it could be because of ONE product that ONLY sells in Brazil, right?

Therefore, I‚Äôm trying to find if the potential drop on sales of Bis can impact MDLZ shares at all. And I‚Äôd like to start by knowing if I can see the percentage of sales of Mondelez Inc by country anywhere on the web. If you know how, please share.

Bottom line, they turned a candy a matter of right x left wing in Brazil and by no doubt the sales gonna have some impact as the engagement of the no Bis no Mondelez propaganda is already making its way out of the X bubble.

1697371995.0,JP Morgan Earnings Beat is a Red Flag," JP Morgan's earnings beat this quarter tells only the rosy part of an otherwise devolving picture. JP Morgan reported a new net debt position on their balance sheet of $42 billion dollars, and they have taken out new debt that they owe other banks and investors over the long term up to levels not seen since 2009. This new debt is very costly, and will leave them chasing higher and higher returns to continue revenue and net income growth. How does a company like JP Morgan, a company that creates no widgets and already services most of the nation in one way or another, to chase higher returns? They will take on more risk (as they have already in the most recent quarter). I am not particularly concerned about deposit flight at JP Morgan - I think that has mostly happened already to the extent that it is going to happen. I am concerned that JPM can report financials that look the way they do in today's rate climate - and receive a standing ovation though. See the graphic below:

First, let's cover the gambling side. The data comes from [this WSJ report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-often-do-gamblers-really-win-1381514164) and it has some fascinating insights. 

When researchers analyzed the performance of 18,000 regular gamblers in casino games, only 13% won over a two-year period.  But, on any given day, if you walk into a casino and play a game like blackjack, roulette, or slots, you have a 30% chance of making a profit. The **only way to win would be to quit while you are ahead**, and most of us won't. 

In the end, the house always wins:

While these numbers look atrocious, they are nothing compared to day trading stats.  **By gambling, you have a 13x better chance of making a profit than when you are day trading.**  

For the study *(*[open access](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/day%20traders/The%20Cross-Section%20of%20Speculator%20Skill.pdf)*)* researchers evaluated the long-term performance of 450K+ day traders from 1992-2006 in the Taiwanese stock market.  The data contained 3.7 billion transactions with a transaction value of $10 trillion.  And almost all day trading was done by individual investors.

The results were eerily similar to gambling. **In a given year, 20% of day traders earned a profit net of fees. But less than 1% of traders from this group could generate a profit the following year.**

The critical question then is whether the alpha produced by this 1% of traders is a result of luck or skill.  This is where it gets interesting. The data shows that the most successful investors continue to earn strong returns, highlighting that **some traders were indeed skilled.**

The top 500 traders (0.1% of the population) had clear performance persistence and earned outsized alpha of 61 bps per day before costs and 38 bps per day after fees.

I use to use thinkorswim canada but it glitched heavy with my computer ( apple m1 chip-compatibility issues).

My fees on thinkorswim for just a couple months were 70k USD when i was trading heavy in options. 
They reduced my fees after I complained- but cant remember by how much. 

I recently stated trading again. I only been trading 2 weeks with a small account (20k-40kUSD) compared to what I used to trade and my fees are up to 9k already. 

I spoke to TD and they said I‚Äôm paying $1.25 USD a contract + $9.99 transaction fee. They said I qualify for a cheaper rate but didnt disclose their offer yet ( I have to wait). I said, I want a rebate since I should not have been paying $1.25 a contract to begin with. 

My questions:
1. For those using TD thinkorswim canada- what are you paying? Curious to hear from our neighbours in the USA as well.

There has to be better options for us Canadians.",wallstreetbets,"Options- Canada, TD web broker $1.25 a contract $9.99 a trade. I can‚Äôt trade on IBRK (they banned me).
I use to use thinkorswim canada but it glitched heavy with my computer ( apple m1 chip-compatibility issues).

My fees on thinkorswim for just a couple months were 70k USD when i was trading heavy in options. 
They reduced my fees after I complained- but cant remember by how much. 

I recently stated trading again. I only been trading 2 weeks with a small account (20k-40kUSD) compared to what I used to trade and my fees are up to 9k already. 

I spoke to TD and they said I‚Äôm paying $1.25 USD a contract + $9.99 transaction fee. They said I qualify for a cheaper rate but didnt disclose their offer yet ( I have to wait). I said, I want a rebate since I should not have been paying $1.25 a contract to begin with. 

My questions:
1. For those using TD thinkorswim canada- what are you paying? Curious to hear from our neighbours in the USA as well.

2. Web broker sucks- anyone else that can recommend another Canadian brokerage or platform? Fills and exist are super slow and have to go under review often.

These milestones include:
Approved PIP plan (prerequisite)
Flaskworks acquisition from Corning

The truth is the vaccine works and is going to help thousands of glioblastoma (GBM) patients immediately upon approval and that number will continue to increase as they ramp up production at their Sawston (UK) production facility 

This is an exciting time for patients battling glioblastoma and for NWBO investors because dcvax will be the first improvement to the standard of care against GBM in over 20 years!

The company was delayed in MAA application but plans to submit mid November.  They also plan on requesting the MHRA 150 business day review.   Most likely sometime in the middle of next year, they will have regulatory approval in the UK to start sending their GBM vaccine, DCvax, to patients

The IRS Says That Will Change.,"Americans didn‚Äôt pay an estimated $688 billion in taxes due on their 2021 returns‚Äîthe largest shortfall ever. Audits and other enforcement will be stepped up to reduce the gap, the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.

The total gap is up more than $138 billion from estimates for tax years 2017 to 2019. Much of the increase is due to economic growth.

Taxpayers‚Äô overall compliance rate is projected to stay relatively steady at 86.3% for tax year 2021, after audits and other enforcement actions.

1697226644.0,Chat GTP Says: Buy Gold,"I'm not very smart, but I know the USA wants war. 

Historically, it's what we've done to grow our economy in times of a downturn. 

So I asked AI ""How does Gold do during war?""

The answer is below, so I did the smart thing and went 100% into $GLD\*

\*Thats a lie, I have $454 in cash for food this next week. 

\----

Historically, gold has often been considered a ""safe-haven"" asset during times of war or geopolitical tension. When conflicts arise, investors may seek to protect their wealth by investing in gold, which has a history of maintaining its value in times of crisis. This is often due to several reasons:

### 1. Store of Value:

Gold has been seen as a store of value for thousands of years. Even when national currencies have depreciated or become unstable, gold has typically retained its purchasing power, making it attractive during uncertain times.

### 2. Hedge Against Inflation:

During wartime, nations might engage in extensive fiscal spending to fund their military efforts, which can lead to inflation. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, helping to preserve wealth.

### 3. Reduced Risk Appetite:

During periods of geopolitical unrest or war, investors may seek to reduce their exposure to more volatile assets, such as equities, and may increase their allocations to perceived safer assets, like gold.

### 4. Currency Debasement:

In times of war, countries might print more money to fund war efforts, leading to currency debasement. Gold, having a limited supply, is often sought after as a means to protect wealth against such debasement.

### Historical Examples:

* **World War II:** During and after World War II, numerous economies were devastated, and currencies often became unstable. Gold, however, retained its value and was used to stabilize currencies and economies in the post-war period.
* **Vietnam War:** During the Vietnam War, especially in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. experienced inflation and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Gold prices rose significantly during this period.
* **Iraq War:** During the early 2000s, when the U.S. and its allies invaded Iraq, gold prices saw an uptick, partly due to the uncertainty and instability created by the conflict.
* **2008 Financial Crisis (not a war, but a period of significant uncertainty):** During the global financial crisis in 2008, gold prices surged as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst the economic downturn.

However, it‚Äôs crucial to note that while gold has often performed well during times of crisis, it is not guaranteed to do so in every circumstance. Various factors, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables, also influence its performance.

Investing always carries risks, and historical trends are not indicative of future performance. Thus, a diversified investment approach that aligns with one's risk tolerance and investment objectives is typically recommended. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.",wallstreetbets,"Chat GTP Says: Buy Gold I'm not very smart, but I know the USA wants war.

Robinhood is a company that disrupted the brokerage industry by offering commission-free stock and options trading through its mobile app and website. The company's mission is to democratize finance and make investing accessible to the masses.

**Investment thesis:**

1. **Growth Potential**: Robinhood's user base has grown significantly since its inception, driven by its easy-to-use platform and commission-free trading. As more people become interested in investing, Robinhood has the potential to capture a growing share of this market. Furthermore, the company has been expanding its product offerings beyond trading, including cryptocurrencies and cash management, which could drive additional growth. Unlike other brokerages, Robinhood provides an easy to use mobile app for the masses.

2. **Monetization Opportunities**: While the company initially offered free trades, it generates revenue through other means, such as payment for order flow and premium subscriptions like Robinhood Gold. Additionally, the expansion into cryptocurrency trading has opened up new revenue streams. As Robinhood continues to innovate and expand its product offerings, it may find new ways to monetize its user base.

3. **Strong User Engagement**: Robinhood has a user-friendly interface that appeals to a younger and more digitally-savvy audience. High user engagement can lead to increased trading activity and more assets under management, potentially driving revenue growth.

4. **Market Trends**: The industry has been experiencing significant growth and innovation. Robinhood is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift toward digital and mobile-first financial services, especially among millennials and Gen Z investors.

 Adam Aron, the controversial CEO of meme-stock darling AMC  Entertainment, sent sexually explicit images and text messages to a  woman he thought was a ballerina who had done ‚Äúunmentionable things‚Äù to  him, according to a bombshell report.

Instead, the woman turned out to be a 34-year-old Bronx con artist  who catfished and attempted to extort the married executive, Aron  admitted Thursday after the news site Semafor reported the sordid tale.

1697200360.0,LLY in the Weight loss industry DD,"This is my first DD so I welcome any feedback that you may have. All currency is in USD. Sorry, no pictures.

LLY launched Mounjaro in May 2022. They are doing a lot of research with obesity drugs, and weight loss drugs are the most researched category in their portfolio. Mounjaro is their weight loss drug and I am very bullish on their success. What Mounjaro does is make you eat less in order to lose weight and if you have an eating problem, Mounjaro makes you think about food less. I think it gives a Dopamine rush to the brain to prevent people from relying on the dopamine when they get full. It does make a massive difference. A friend of mine takes Mounjaro and she tells me it makes a massive difference. She states that Mounjaro takes away the ""food noise"" in her head, so she doesn't continually think about food. When you first take Mounjaro, you will have morning sickness for 2-3 days, but if you use it right before you go to sleep you will sleep through most of it. There are rumors about other health problems, but the only continuing side effect my friend mentioned is a little constipation. She states that MiraLAX takes that problem away fast.

Numbers from Quarterly reports

Total revenue for LLY during Q1 was $6.96 Billion. Mounjaro Revenue was $568.5 million which is 8.1% of revenue for Q1. Mounjaro is the 4th biggest revenue producer for LLY in Q1, the 2nd biggest in Q2 and 3rd biggest of all of 2023 revenue. Mounjaro is $100 million behind Verzenio revenue YTD, and behind Trulicity which is a little less than double Mounjaro's revenue YTD. I think Mounjaro will overtake Trulicity for first place in the amount of revenue because of the big increases in revenues Q/Q. Q2 revenue was $8.31 Billion. Mounjaro revenue was $979.7 million, which represents a 42% increase Q/Q. LLY increased 2023 revenue guidance in Q1 and in Q2 to $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion which is a 6% - 7% increase from the previous guidance. If Mounjaro revenue stays at the constant rate of $979.7 million per quarter for 4 quarters it will make up 11.4% of all of LLY revenue for the year according to the guidance revenue.¬†Mounjaro has only started seeing this big increase in sales since the start of 2023, so I believe that Mounjaro still has a lot of room to grow.

From a balance sheet perspective, LLY has $54.814 billion in total assets and $18.158 Billion in long term debt.  They paid down the $1.4 billion in short term debt they had. They have $2.5 billion in their share repurchase program.  They have $2.694 billion in cash. Long term debt increased by $4 billion YTD. LLY also recently bought POINT biopharma for $1.4 Billion which will help other drug advancements as well and their obesity drug portfolio.¬†Net income of the first 2 Quarters was $3.108 Billion.

Prices using Q2 Revenue

If you buy a box of Mounjaro it comes with four shots that you take weekly. The local hospital near me will charge you in 1 of 3 ways: full retail price, which is $940 a box or $12,200 a year. Alternatively, you can get the manufacturing discount which is $790 per box or $10,270 a year. The last pricing model depends on your insurance. It is difficult to determine the net price insurance companies pay. However, more insurance companies are starting to cover Mounjaro for obesity, which will make it more assessable and drive revenue. On slide 11 for the Q2 presentation it shows that there were about 1,500,000 paid prescriptions during Q2, which would mean each box is being sold for about $653. This makes sense to me because insurance companies can negotiate better discounts than $790 per box previously stated.

Earnings

I expect them to beat their next quarterly earnings forecast because of increased Mounjaro sales and a growing market for obesity drugs. Analysts say that the obesity drug market will be over $100 billion dollars by 2030. I think that only two companies have the opportunity to dominate that market, which are LLY and NVO. I don't have a price target but they have been on my radar for a few months now. I bought some shares recently at $595. Earnings are on November 2nd.

Total revenue for LLY during Q1 was $6.96 Billion. Mounjaro Revenue was $568.5 million which is 8.1% of revenue for Q1. Mounjaro is the 4th biggest revenue producer for LLY in Q1, the 2nd biggest in Q2 and 3rd biggest of all of 2023 revenue. Mounjaro is $100 million behind Verzenio revenue YTD, and behind Trulicity which is a little less than double Mounjaro's revenue YTD. I think Mounjaro will overtake Trulicity for first place in the amount of revenue because of the big increases in revenues Q/Q. Q2 revenue was $8.31 Billion. Mounjaro revenue was $979.7 million, which represents a 42% increase Q/Q. LLY increased 2023 revenue guidance in Q1 and in Q2 to $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion which is a 6% - 7% increase from the previous guidance. If Mounjaro revenue stays at the constant rate of $979.7 million per quarter for 4 quarters it will make up 11.4% of all of LLY revenue for the year according to the guidance revenue.¬†Mounjaro has only started seeing this big increase in sales since the start of 2023, so I believe that Mounjaro still has a lot of room to grow.

From a balance sheet perspective, LLY has $54.814 billion in total assets and $18.158 Billion in long term debt.  They paid down the $1.4 billion in short term debt they had. They have $2.5 billion in their share repurchase program.  They have $2.694 billion in cash. Long term debt increased by $4 billion YTD. LLY also recently bought POINT biopharma for $1.4 Billion which will help other drug advancements as well and their obesity drug portfolio.¬†Net income of the first 2 Quarters was $3.108 Billion.

Prices using Q2 Revenue

If you buy a box of Mounjaro it comes with four shots that you take weekly. The local hospital near me will charge you in 1 of 3 ways: full retail price, which is $940 a box or $12,200 a year. Alternatively, you can get the manufacturing discount which is $790 per box or $10,270 a year. The last pricing model depends on your insurance. It is difficult to determine the net price insurance companies pay. However, more insurance companies are starting to cover Mounjaro for obesity, which will make it more assessable and drive revenue. On slide 11 for the Q2 presentation it shows that there were about 1,500,000 paid prescriptions during Q2, which would mean each box is being sold for about $653. This makes sense to me because insurance companies can negotiate better discounts than $790 per box previously stated.

Earnings

I expect them to beat their next quarterly earnings forecast because of increased Mounjaro sales and a growing market for obesity drugs. Analysts say that the obesity drug market will be over $100 billion dollars by 2030. I think that only two companies have the opportunity to dominate that market, which are LLY and NVO. I don't have a price target but they have been on my radar for a few months now. I bought some shares recently at $595. Earnings are on November 2nd.

Thanks for reading my DD. I welcome any feedback or comments that you may have on my thoughts and analysis."

1697172139.0,Market Profile Analysis on TSLA going into Friday's Session,"I wanted to share some of my observations on TSLA from a TPO chart. Just some context on what a TPO chart exactly is - 

TPO  stands for ‚ÄúTime Price Opportunity‚Äù. Each TPO, denoted by a single letter, represents a point of time where the security trades at a specific price.¬† A single TPO is printed on the chart every time that a certain price (in my example for TSLA each block is 10 cents) is touched during any time period.¬† Typically, the periods are set to 30 minutes.¬† Therefore, every different letter that you see in the  distribution denotes a different 30 minute period. 

Basically we're analyzing the amount of trading activity, based on time. I also utilize a similar chart but for volume instead of time. Now to the analysis. 

There's a few important takeaways for me from Thursday's session. 

We created a poor high.  This is indicated by multiple letters at the high and a lack of a clear tail like we see for the 10-11 session highs. A ""poor high"" on a TPO chart indicates an abrupt halt in upward price movement, often lacking excess. It suggests an incomplete auction.  The poor high has two forward looking indications. The first is that prices should back away from the poor high as there are a number of longs trapped at poor location. The second is that if the next day or in some subsequent session, the poor high is revisited, then the odds are strong that it will break and move higher. This is called repair as it repairs the structure of the poor high that lacked symmetry without a proper ‚Äútop‚Äù. 

We can also see that there was not much interest in trading around 260.40 - 260.90 range and a new distribution was setup lower at the close.  

Based on afternoon trading, I prefer bears going into Friday's session. Bears will look to defend 260.90 and prevent the stock from trading into the original distribution. Target would be 255, as that is an area where we have spent a lot of time in last Friday and Monday's session. 

The strategy is simply to play with the single prints as that is indicative of a lack of interest in that area and take profit near the highest point in the distribution, as we expect to spend a large amount of time trading in that area.

1697163618.0,SP500 Bounce Losing Momentum,"Sp500 had a nice almost 5% bounce off of the 200 day moving average at 4200, and now it looks like the momentum is weakening. I'm not aware of any catalyst that triggered the sell-off near SP500 4400 today other than just algo trading. While 4200 could potentially be a low before the year end rally, it feels a little pricy (4000-4100 seems like a more favorable risk-reward tradeoff to me). Also, the VIX only got to 20 at 4200 so that seems a bit low for the correction to end, maybe more towards mid 20 VIX seems reasonable.

Rising 10 year rate has been driving most of the stock movement over the past 2 months. Yellen is issuing a lot of treasury (\~1.5 trillion), and there just aren't a lot of bond buyers left. The Israel conflict was a catalyst for people to buy the safety of 10 year bond, but I suspect most of the buyers have already bought by now. The Fed is pretty concerned about how quickly the 10 year rate is rising, which could eventually lead to a financial accident, so they are trying to calm the bond market a little bit by stepping off the hawkish talk. Ultimately, bond buyers will need to see the economy weaken before feeling comfortable catching the the falling knife, and we're not seeing that quite yet with 300k job growth last Friday, and strong core CPI today (auto inflation was unusually weak, which offset the very strong monthly housing inflation. Auto inflation is volatile, but I don't expect the weak trend to last, especially with ongoing UAW strike lowering car inventory).

While I'm not sure if 4200 was the low, I think the market will go back down close to that level. Yield is back to 4.7% and if it goes past 5% from any catalyst, SP500 will have a big sell off. If it stays around 4.7%, I think we should be prepared to buy around 4100-4200 levels, especially if government shutdown talk resumes this month, triggering more sell-off.

1697159081.0,SAVA is a short,"Long a target of short sellers, Casava sciences now is really in deep.

They are a biotech firm with one drug in phase 3 trials, Simufilam for the treatment of alzheimers.  The co-author of the research that underpins the drug is now accused of fabricating data for more than 20 papers, all the way back to 2012.

Right now, even after dropping 30% overnight, it's still worth 2x book value.  It should be valued at 1x book value (at maximum).

There were many short reports on this company, but now that both publications like [science.org](https://science.org) and CUNY are looking into the company, it's only a matter of time until the Phase 3 trials are stopped and the company is dead.  Unlike previous attempts to ""fight the FUD"" as it were, the professor now needs to actually produce the data in a way that satisfies CUNY.  It will be a lot harder for the company to pump the stock and fight back with PR (thus making the possibility of a short squeeze less likely).

**Backtest: Best Options Trade After a Stock Gaps Down**

**Should you sell options after a stock experiences a multi-standard deviation sell-off from an unexpected event (company/industry specific)?**

**Conclusion:**

\~6.2k relevant data points from the 1.4mm sample (past 5 years). After a stock experiences a 1-day, 3+ standard deviation sell-off:

* Stocks rallied 1% on average over the following month (\~70% of that rally in the first week)
* Short vol underperforms ‚Äì if you sold every straddle you lost \~8%
* Selling the largest vol increases tends to be better
* Selling vol in the smallest z-score sell-offs tends to be better
* Selling the most expensive vols (absolute % cost) tends to be better
* Selling vol in staples and healthcare, buying vol in energy and real estate tends to be better

**Data:**

We used all US listed equities with average 2Y option open interest >10k.

We looked at the past 5 years of data, using the following criteria to identify multi-standard deviation sell-offs likely caused by company/industry specific:

* Stock > 2.9 stdev sell off vs stock 1M implied ‚Äì stock sold off significantly relative to expected move based on option price
* SPX > -2% & SPX > 2 stdev sell-off vs SPX 1M implied ‚Äì capture days when whole market sold off in both high and low vol environments.
* 1M implied > 90% of 1M implied (t-1) ‚Äì removed names that sold off significantly due to a non-eps, known event
* Removed earnings

**Results**

Is it better to sell options when the vol increases or decreases?

* Buying straddles was better if the implied vol decreased or only increased slightly.
* Selling straddles was better if the implied vol increased significantly

The producer price index (wholesale price) is up 0.5% month to month. Beating the expected 0.3% rise MoM for September. CPI this Thursday will be bad as well (trust me bro). However, the US10Y is down yesterday and today. This is NOT because inflation is going down but due to the flight to safety because of the conflicts between Israel and Hamas (in time of worries, people buy treasuries as a safe haven which pushes down yield). However, combining wars with a strong labor markets, union strikes, and crazy consumers spending, inflation is **NOT** going away anytime soon. As a matter of facts, just like the 70's, it will come back with a revenge. This inflation 'fight' may last up to a decade. YES a DECADE.  

Wall Street and Hedge Funds hate QT and normal (Not high!) interest rates. They are crying for the FED to cut rates and relaunch QEs again. They need more assets bubbles to inflate away their debts and inflate their assets to kingdom 'CUM'! At the same time, QEs have caused F\*\*KING huge wealth gaps. They or the 1% want the people to work for pennies while they can borrow for free and get unlimited printed money. Well F\*ck them! They have been calling for a recession for a while now! Eventually that will happen but your puts will have expired by then!

&#x200B;

[Recession is coming](https://reddit.com/link/175pqx0/video/4rsy06tjumtb1/player)

Don't believe all these PIVOT talks. They are pure propaganda BS. Inflation is here to stay. At some point in the future, YES we will head back to the 2% target rate. But only if all of these three things happen together. 

1. Interest rate must be well **ABOVE** the inflation rate. YES! We need interest rate to go much higher! 5.25-5.50% is still historically very low and that is not high enough to combat inflation! For example, if car prices are going up 10% a year and saving rate is 5%, are you stupid enough to wait to buy a car next year? No, you buy it now! If you wait, you lose out. You will only wait to buy if saving rate is 12% or 13% or higher! 
2. Government cannot spend more money then they take in! US government cannot do deficit spendings anymore. This year alone we will have a over 2 trillions dollars deficit. This is like pouring gasoline onto the fire. Interest rate is still not high enough to force anal pain to the drunken morons in the government. STOP spending money you don't have Assh\*les! 
3. All the asset bubbles must BURST! The Everything Bubble must go BUST! This includes housing bubble, stock bubble, bond bubble, sh\*tcoin bubble, art sh\*t bubble, classic sh\*t car button, luxury sh\*t watches bubble, etc. Too much money was printed and it went into mal-investments. This must stop and normal asset prices must match their fundamentals.    

What is the probability of all of these 3 things happening this year or next? 0.00001% (again, trust me bro). 

Now wait, you are probably thinking Oh Great Regard, if asset bubbles burst and prices come crashing down, wouldn't that bring down inflation. **NO NO NO NO!!!!** You are confusing asset prices with consumer prices! Assets prices like stocks, bonds, houses, etc., are prices or costs of investments. Consumer prices are prices of everyday things we need! Things like your monthly shelter cost, food cost, energy cost, transportation cost, etc.  So if house prices crashed 50%, it doesn't matter. They don't use house prices in the CPI anyway. They use owners' equivalent rent measurements which have been underestimating real rents for decades. Just think about this, your landlords have a mortgage on the property they rent to you. Housing prices crashed 50% but at the same time, his costs like property taxes, maintenance costs, mortgage go up or stay the same. Do you fu\*king think you can ask for 50% drop in monthly rents? F\*\*KED NO! 

We have been printed money since QE1 Nov 2008 so why didn't we get inflation? We got QE1, QE2, QE3, etc, so what gives? Well, to have inflation you need three things: 

1. Money Supply (M1/M2)  --> Ding Ding  (money is created)

2. Velocity of Money Supply  --> X  (money gets to the consumers)

3. Dumb Idiots to spend it again --> X (Money gets recirculated through the economy)  

We had 1 but not 2 or 3. Look at [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)

So why didn't we get money velocity? What happened to all the money from QEs and suppressed low interest rates? Well, the money (most of it) went to the 1% MF c\*cksuckers at Wall Street, Hedge funds, Billionaires, Money losing start-ups, which didn't need the money in the first place and invested most of that crap in stocks, bonds, real estates, sh\*tcoins, etc. That money got sucked into mal-investments and were not spent into the economy! That ended with the COVID-19 pandemics when money finally hit the average people on main street. See the green circle I draw with my green Crayola. Once we got 2 and 3, we are now officially f\*\*cked! 

Summary

Long story, short. Interest rate will be normal again. Not high, normal again. QE is a thing of the past. All of the problems we have today is because of government deficit spendings and the QEs that enable it. We cannot go back to 0% rate or QEs. You need to invest wisely again.

As a matter of facts, just like the 70's, it will come back with a revenge. This inflation 'fight' may last up to a decade. YES a DECADE.  

Wall Street and Hedge Funds hate QT and normal (Not high!) interest rates. They are crying for the FED to cut rates and relaunch QEs again. They need more assets bubbles to inflate away their debts and inflate their assets to kingdom 'CUM'! At the same time, QEs have caused F\*\*KING huge wealth gaps. They or the 1% want the people to work for pennies while they can borrow for free and get unlimited printed money. Well F\*ck them! They have been calling for a recession for a while now! Eventually that will happen but your puts will have expired by then!

Don't believe all these PIVOT talks. They are pure propaganda BS. Inflation is here to stay. At some point in the future, YES we will head back to the 2% target rate. But only if all of these three things happen together. 

1. Interest rate must be well **ABOVE** the inflation rate. YES! We need interest rate to go much higher! 5.25-5.50% is still historically very low and that is not high enough to combat inflation! For example, if car prices are going up 10% a year and saving rate is 5%, are you stupid enough to wait to buy a car next year? No, you buy it now! If you wait, you lose out. You will only wait to buy if saving rate is 12% or 13% or higher! 
2. Government cannot spend more money then they take in! US government cannot do deficit spendings anymore. This year alone we will have a over 2 trillions dollars deficit. This is like pouring gasoline onto the fire. Interest rate is still not high enough to force anal pain to the drunken morons in the government. STOP spending money you don't have Assh\*les! 
3. All the asset bubbles must BURST! The Everything Bubble must go BUST! This includes housing bubble, stock bubble, bond bubble, sh\*tcoin bubble, art sh\*t bubble, classic sh\*t car button, luxury sh\*t watches bubble, etc. Too much money was printed and it went into mal-investments. This must stop and normal asset prices must match their fundamentals.    

What is the probability of all of these 3 things happening this year or next? 0.00001% (again, trust me bro). 

Now wait, you are probably thinking Oh Great Regard, if asset bubbles burst and prices come crashing down, wouldn't that bring down inflation. **NO NO NO NO!!!!** You are confusing asset prices with consumer prices! Assets prices like stocks, bonds, houses, etc., are prices or costs of investments. Consumer prices are prices of everyday things we need! Things like your monthly shelter cost, food cost, energy cost, transportation cost, etc.  So if house prices crashed 50%, it doesn't matter. They don't use house prices in the CPI anyway. They use owners' equivalent rent measurements which have been underestimating real rents for decades. Just think about this, your landlords have a mortgage on the property they rent to you. Housing prices crashed 50% but at the same time, his costs like property taxes, maintenance costs, mortgage go up or stay the same. Do you fu\*king think you can ask for 50% drop in monthly rents? F\*\*KED NO! 

We have been printed money since QE1 Nov 2008 so why didn't we get inflation? We got QE1, QE2, QE3, etc, so what gives? Well, to have inflation you need three things: 

1. Money Supply (M1/M2)  --> Ding Ding  (money is created)

2. Velocity of Money Supply  --> X  (money gets to the consumers)

3. Dumb Idiots to spend it again --> X (Money gets recirculated through the economy)  

We had 1 but not 2 or 3. Look at [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V) 

&#x200B;

[Money got stuck in sh\*tcoin or other bad \\""investment\\""](https://preview.redd.it/m24ba8d70ntb1.jpg?width=1706&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=facf40ccb0da96c8cf3f700972dae89bac0f0794)

So why didn't we get money velocity? What happened to all the money from QEs and suppressed low interest rates? Well, the money (most of it) went to the 1% MF c\*cksuckers at Wall Street, Hedge funds, Billionaires, Money losing start-ups, which didn't need the money in the first place and invested most of that crap in stocks, bonds, real estates, sh\*tcoins, etc. That money got sucked into mal-investments and were not spent into the economy! That ended with the COVID-19 pandemics when money finally hit the average people on main street. See the green circle I draw with my green Crayola. Once we got 2 and 3, we are now officially f\*\*cked! 

Summary

Long story, short. Interest rate will be normal again. Not high, normal again. QE is a thing of the past. All of the problems we have today is because of government deficit spendings and the QEs that enable it. We cannot go back to 0% rate or QEs. You need to invest wisely again.  "

This is mostly anecdotal, and as someone who is a permanent bull I rarely think the market is influenced by anything other than greed. Even right now with treasury yield being so high instead of it hurting the market, it's mostly been interpreted as doing the work of the central bank, and taking money out of the market and putting downward pressure on inflation.

BUT, as a lawyer who has not had to make any student loan payments I know lots of people that bought houses at crazy low rates and they're $2000 monthly student loan payments were not factored into DTI ratios.  But, those payments are coming back.  However, I don't know if the percentage of people affected  is enough to actually hurt banks enough. There is going to be a ton of people that cannot afford a mortgage.

It should also make it, so if any of those people with large student loan payments  (in particular anybody who stayed in school post undergrad) will no longer qualify for a mortgage.  

But as rates go down, which will hurt the value of banks with large bonds on their books (what sunk Silicon Valley Bank) seems like there could be a good short opportunity,

These companies are soaring today because of this [news](https://www.novonordisk.com/news-and-media/news-and-ir-materials/news-details.html?id=166327), this trial was supposed to go on for another year in order to demonstrate that NVO's drug can reduce kidney disease. The trial went so well it got ended a year early. This isn't exactly a surprise that the drug did well here, but anyways science is science and you need a real trial to demonstrate this shit

Since my original DD I've done a lot more research into the GLP-1 market, something I did not realize is that LLY's drug Tirzepatide is [more effective](https://www.healthline.com/health/tirzepatide-vs-semaglutide#weight-loss-research) than NVO's semagultide. The one thing NVO has an advantage to is that their oral version of semalgultide should be out this year, however LLY's oral version has phase 3 trials ending in 2025. As part of the S&P complex I think LLY can experience more rotation flow from the historical dispersion that has been going on, also Druckenmiller has a 5% allocation to LLY so I decided to rotate some of my NVO bags to LLY maybe a month ago. I am planning to rotate some more. There are other GLP-1 drug companies as well that I am barely doing DD on but I find intriguing

1697001606.0,Apple Inc. Faces Steep Decline in Stock Price as Q4 Sales Projections Wane,"In a surprising turn of events for tech giant Apple Inc., the company's stock price is poised for a significant downturn in the final quarter of 2023. 
The just broke it‚Äôs 4 days winning streak and the volume is much lower than normal.
Numerous indicators, including a decline in projected sales and worrisome economic factors, suggest a challenging period ahead for one of the world's most valuable companies.

The Google search engine lawsuit also weighs heavily on the company and it can cause a significant earnings drop if the arrangement was to be cancelled. Apple has not yet launched any major AI enabled capability and the sales volume for the newly launched IPhone 15 look dismal. Chinese customers are cautious and the recent ban on government officials carrying iPhone is also causing a dip in the demand.

Apple's Q4 2023 sales projections have fallen short of expectations, sending ripples throughout the financial markets. Analysts, who previously anticipated a robust quarter, have revised their forecasts downward, citing multiple factors contributing to the decline.

The latest sales figures show a dip in iPhone sales, a critical source of revenue for the company, primarily due to market saturation and consumers holding onto their devices for longer periods. Moreover, supply chain issues have constrained product availability, resulting in delayed launches and unfulfilled demand.

Several economic factors are also contributing to Apple's woes. A recent hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has tightened consumer spending, impacting the purchasing power of prospective Apple customers. Rising inflation has made Apple's premium products less affordable for consumers, creating a headwind for sales.

Furthermore, global economic uncertainty and ongoing trade disputes have disrupted the company's international market operations. Supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions have driven up production costs, further pressuring Apple's margins.

As of October 11, 2023, Apple's stock (AAPL) is trading at $178.39 per share, a significant drop from its 52-week high of $198.23. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted to 29.98, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the company's future growth prospects. The company's market capitalization now stands at $2.79 trillion.

Looking at technical indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, traditionally considered a bearish sign, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued or experiencing strong selling pressure.

Investor sentiment is undoubtedly shifting. While Apple has long been considered a safe haven for investors, a growing number of shareholders are expressing concerns about the company's ability to sustain its historic growth rate. The sentiment is reflected in the significant increase in short interest over the past month, as more investors bet on the stock's decline.

Apple Inc. finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a multitude of challenges that are impacting its sales and stock price. With declining sales projections, economic headwinds, and a changing investor sentiment, the company's stock price is likely to experience a sharp decline in the coming quarters. Apple's ability to adapt and navigate these challenges will be closely watched by investors and market analysts worldwide.",wallstreetbets,"Apple Inc. Faces Steep Decline in Stock Price as Q4 Sales Projections Wane In a surprising turn of events for tech giant Apple Inc., the company's stock price is poised for a significant downturn in the final quarter of 2023. 
The just broke it‚Äôs 4 days winning streak and the volume is much lower than normal.
Numerous indicators, including a decline in projected sales and worrisome economic factors, suggest a challenging period ahead for one of the world's most valuable companies.

The Google search engine lawsuit also weighs heavily on the company and it can cause a significant earnings drop if the arrangement was to be cancelled. Apple has not yet launched any major AI enabled capability and the sales volume for the newly launched IPhone 15 look dismal. Chinese customers are cautious and the recent ban on government officials carrying iPhone is also causing a dip in the demand.

Apple's Q4 2023 sales projections have fallen short of expectations, sending ripples throughout the financial markets. Analysts, who previously anticipated a robust quarter, have revised their forecasts downward, citing multiple factors contributing to the decline.

The latest sales figures show a dip in iPhone sales, a critical source of revenue for the company, primarily due to market saturation and consumers holding onto their devices for longer periods. Moreover, supply chain issues have constrained product availability, resulting in delayed launches and unfulfilled demand.

Several economic factors are also contributing to Apple's woes. A recent hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has tightened consumer spending, impacting the purchasing power of prospective Apple customers. Rising inflation has made Apple's premium products less affordable for consumers, creating a headwind for sales.

Furthermore, global economic uncertainty and ongoing trade disputes have disrupted the company's international market operations. Supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions have driven up production costs, further pressuring Apple's margins.

As of October 11, 2023, Apple's stock (AAPL) is trading at $178.39 per share, a significant drop from its 52-week high of $198.23. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted to 29.98, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the company's future growth prospects. The company's market capitalization now stands at $2.79 trillion.

Looking at technical indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, traditionally considered a bearish sign, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued or experiencing strong selling pressure.

Investor sentiment is undoubtedly shifting. While Apple has long been considered a safe haven for investors, a growing number of shareholders are expressing concerns about the company's ability to sustain its historic growth rate. The sentiment is reflected in the significant increase in short interest over the past month, as more investors bet on the stock's decline.

Apple Inc. finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a multitude of challenges that are impacting its sales and stock price. With declining sales projections, economic headwinds, and a changing investor sentiment, the company's stock price is likely to experience a sharp decline in the coming quarters.

2. Uber eats is fucking $40 for a Taco Bell meal, you diahrea and thus lose 80% of the nutrients so 10 calories for $40.  That ratio is worse than in refugee camps.

3.  People at work: my credit card is maxed out

4. Online retailers in niche industries (literally this week): We now offer Afirm!  And other finance options for things that cost $100.00. Credit crunch is here.

5.  Student loans nice little cherry on top 

6. Car monthly payments are on average 2x per month in last 2 years compared to last decade.

7.  White collar job income increasing well below rate of inflation 

8. Record ownership of rental properties by individuals, short and long term.  Not everyone is built to be landlords, not everyone is ready for taxes (get ready for tax liens) while not able to even fully pay their mortgages with rent or Airbnb (and don‚Äôt forget they might be on ARM because banks had to justify the risk of lending to these people)

9.  Luxury market for watches died

10. Market for firearms has died.  Guns are insanely cheap & plentiful during a time when the atf is actually banning millions of firearms (ar pistols) that usually cause panic buying.  Firearms market is usually incredibly robust.  Especially during Democrat presidency.

1696963470.0,The bond market is signaling that the economy is fucked,"Last week, I posted [an explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16y44xr/10yr_bond_yields_are_spiking_what_does_this_mean/) of what the spiking long-term bond yields mean for the economy. VM gave a great TLDR:  *The Fed's rate hikes are finally having their intended effect of sucking liquidity out of the system. This will lead to a sell-off in risk assets, and potentially a recession.*

But there was one loose thread in my thesis there. When recession is imminent, the yield curve should un-invert by having the short-term yields collapse below the long-term yields. But the un-inversion we were witnessing was happening in the opposite direction. Long-term yields were rising to meet short-term. So how and when would the un-inversion flip from one mechanism to the other?

Well, just a week later, it's happening. Short-term yields have begun their collapse. Long-term yields are also declining now, but slower than short-term, meaning the un-inversion continues. The economy is ***fucked***. We have entered the final stage of the bubble pop.

**Here's why:**

Imagine you're a savvy investor or finance professional, and you have a ton of cash sitting in short-term Treasury bills (or your HYSA, or whatever). That money is still pretty liquid, and available to jump on investment opportunities, buy houses, etc. You saw the rise in 10yr yields and thought to yourself, ""well 4.8% for 10 years is nice, but I'm happier getting 5.7% in my 6 month bonds for now.""

But now too many people are follow that strategy, buying up the short-term bonds, and those short-term yields start to collapse. Your advantage over a long-term strategy starts to suffer. *Even worse* is, you see the long-term yields start to go down a little bit too! What if they keep going? This might be your last chance to lock-in >4% for 10 years! Okay, better take your available cash and park it in those long-term bonds.

Suddenly, your liquidity is gone. But everyone else is in the same boat as you. *Everyone's* liquidity is gone. That ocean of money that was keeping prices and employment high just evaporated. And that's how you get a recession.

Im Buying/Bought $ISRG PUTS. Only Two Surgical Robots approved by the FDA. Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG enjoyed a literal monopoly for over two decades and just two years before pandemic worldwide pause, a second ever contender was FDA approved. Now it's post pandemic and it's on like Donkey Kong.

Intuitive and another one that is super low market cap, wsb bot won't let me post name without deleting my post, due to it's market cap. But it's interesting to note, that despite it's small market cap, it is completely DEBT FREE, and has powerful investors / board seat members, like Andrea Biffi, from SOFAR, an Italian pharma heavy weight, now MA'd(Merger Aquisitioned) by an even larger Pharma: Alfasigma, THE LARGEST Pharmaceutical company in Italy. So I wont name it. But I believe this small Market Cap contender will eventually cause ISRG to tumble and thus making ISRG a juicy short within the next year. It's close to 300 bucks right now. So I'm buying puts on ISRG.

Intuitive has super crappy technology vs recently FDA approved competitor. Competitor of Intuitive is less expensive. And has Re usable tools. Haptic Feedback for Surgeon. Eyetracking Camera. Google Cloud Healthcare AI and Nvidia partnership.

1. More on Google Health Care AI Cloud Colab, Competitor has had a formal collab since February of this year: Note what Ashima Gupta Global Director of Healthcare For Google AI Cloud said back then:

2. Note what Director Said in Today's (10-9-23) Press Release to CNBC :

‚ÄúThese are the workflows that the physicians and nurses live by day in and day out. You can‚Äôt be adding friction to it,‚Äù Gupta told CNBC in an interview. ‚ÄúWe are very cautious of that ‚Äî that we are respecting the surface they use, that the workflow doesn‚Äôt change, but yet they get the power of this technology.‚Äù Link to today's press release: where quote is from:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html)

NOTE: The Hospitals that are part of Googles First Release for beta release ARE THE SAME HOSPITALS WITH SENHANCES Surgical Robots. Mayo Clinic and Hackensak. Please note that the Competitor is working to UPLOAD live video and picures and all kinds of DATASETS for AI and AI search for HEALTHCARE FIELD. Competitor has Senhances worldwide with over 10,000 procedures and like Tesla's record driver data and add it to Nueralink, the same happens with each Senhance that EACH SURGEON DRIVES, and Google / NVIDIA / Competitor are getting all Surgical Dataset gold. Very likely Google will pay Senhance creators a royalty to Competitor of ISRG. The fact is ISRG is flatfooted and will get rocked by this collab. When you see videos, links below, you will see Hackensack. And you will also see pic of Mayo Clinic Pediatrics anouncement a little over two weeks ago. See below for pics and links for further info/research/dd.

Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG eye gauges the poor hospitals and surgeons by requiring them to buy new tools every 5th, 10th, 12th, or MAX: 18th surgical procedure-depending on the tool robotic tip.  Yes you read that correct. EVERY 18th SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The bulk of their revenues comes from this obvious and  unsustainable eye gauging. Vs Competitor, whose tools are able to be re used indefinitely for life of tool. One Surgical Robot Surgeon mentioned they had been using the same tools from the Competitor for over 3 years!!Please google-I have links below-but you can google for yourselves also if you like:  Carlos Mendoza Herrera Master Surgeon from Cedar Sinai in Chicago. Also google = Amit Travedi , Hackensack Medical Hospital, Carlos Mendoza Herrera / Sinai Chicago, links below.

Notice picture=Also notice the open cockpit design of Competitor vs ISRG. ISRG surgical Robot Da  Vinci kills your peripheral view and forces you to hunch over, and you lose your clear line of sight of operating table and staff. Your head needs to go inside a hole in the machine.  Then you need to stare through two more holes. While on Senhance from Competitor, you keep a clear line of sight, sit comfortably upright and maintain a clear line of sight on operating table and staff. And stare a beautiful screen that's in front of you.

Competitor to ISRG currently has a formal Google Healthcare Cloud Agreement since February. And another formal agreement with juggernaut Nvidia, anounced much more recently-see pics below.

Mayo Clinic recently added the Competitors Surgical robot over Da Vinci becuase of all the aformentioned PLUS ISRG DOES NOT HAVE 3mm ports. In other words, 3mm is the literal size the robotic arms can cut to enter the thoracic cavity in order to operate. And so after surgical procedure, you don't have a foot long gaping wound stitched from which to heal from, but literally a 3mm cut. maybe like three 3mm cuts from which to heal from. An Inch is 25mm. To give you an idea of how small that is and how fast post operative healing can be especially for tiny infants that are a month old that can't handle 8mm or 12mm cuts the smallest ISRG has.

ISRG will take years to get FDA approval for a complete refresh to compete with an open cockpit design where the surgeon is upright looking at a screen. Also ISRG will take years to get 3mm approved and field pre clinically tested. Things the competitor ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVED AND IN THE MARKET AS THE MAYO CLINIC RECENTLY SHOWED. ISRG in their monopolistic comfort rested on it's laurels technology never bothered or cared to refresh their tech and upgrade, because they were the only game in town and never had to for over two decades so hospitals and doctors had to deal with what they ( $ISRG) gave them. Now they're caught flat footed.

\*A little deviation on what is Laparoscopy -and why Robotic Surgery is an evolution to that:

So the question I keep asking myself is WHY hasn't ISRG come up with 3mm port and a better open cockpit design in 23 years of their monopoly? Because they've never really needed to improve their lower tier tech, because there literally was NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAN THEM. This led to massive abuse on their part, more on that below, lawsuits and unhappy Hospitals and medical centers.

All robotic surgery crux is a minimally invasive surgery from smaller wounds you can heal from. so your up and running faster, with less pain, and can return to work, family, your routine in a much shorter time span than from an open surgery that leaves a massive wound maybe a foot long, that cuts through muscle, tendons, perhaps bones. Please see video links below for more explanation on this. They are short videos, like 2-5 minutes long. Laparoscopy was the MANUAL way of minimally invasive surgery, meaning an endoscopic camera gets placed inside your body, through a small incision and two tiny arms that are controlled manually, obviously this is a challenging form of surgery, but under skilled surgeons, extremely successful. With robotic surgery you have the steady hand, tremor free, you're able to sit down through out the process, and lessen the fatigue of hours long surgeries, ergo more successful, and safer surgeries, perhaps one after the other. Plus Software like no fly zones where the robot arm cannot extend and injure or maim a certain organ accidentally-something not avail with manual Laparascopy. Something ISRG does NOT have but Senhance does. See Lawsuits link below. Also measuring distances between organs, etc, can be done with software. VS inserting a phsyical sterilized ruler which was the way it was done before manually without the robotics-but still done with ISRG. Also articulated instruments inside the abdomen, add more dexterity with robotic surgical systems.  These are the advantages of Robotic Surgeriy over manual minimally invasive Laparoscopic surgeries. So robotic surgery is a level above manual laparascopy. Manaual Laparascopy was a level up from traditional open surgery.\*

Hospitals Fighting ISRG Monopoly

Here's an excerpt from above link, of the monopolistic bully tactics ISRG has used throughout the years to maintain their monopolistic revenues when you have had zero competition, ANY enterprise will earn substantial revenues  in a market with ZERO COMPETITION: ESPECIALLY FOR OVER TWO DECADES:  Excerpt, these are REAL LAWSUITS:

""**Driving the news:** In one allegation, a hospital says Intuitive Surgical remotely shut down a hospital's surgical robot ""in the middle of a procedure"" which forced the surgeon ""to convert the procedure to open surgery with the patient on the operating table,"" after the hospital said it was considering a service contract with a third party.""

Lawsuits:

[https://www.drugwatch.com/davinci-surgery/lawsuits/](https://www.drugwatch.com/davinci-surgery/lawsuits/)

""Many of the most recent da Vinci settlements have come from malpractice suits against surgeons. For example, in 2021, a 56-year-year old man received a $700,000 settlement after he sued his surgeon for cutting a hepatic duct during a da Vinci-assisted gallbladder procedure."" (Looks like this surgeon could have benefited from the No Fly Zone software Senhance has to AVOID robot arms accidentally harming interior organs during operation, that ISRG lacks)

[https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/new-concerns-on-robotic-surgeries/](https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/new-concerns-on-robotic-surgeries/)

Hospitals in Japan and Germany, and USA(Now the Mayo Clinic as of last week), using Senhance over Da Vinci. Why didn't the Mayo Clinic simply get another Da Vinci for their Pediatrics? Because Da Vinci lacks 3mm ports for small infants and children. Senhance has had recent Pediatric FDA approval.

Luna is the 2.0 from Competitor and will deal the final blow.

Based on Latest Cantor Fitzgerald Healthcare Expo, about a week ago, COO mentioned they had a clear 510 clearance for LUNA. The 2.0 iteration to Senhance.  Please note: Competitor has an excellent track record in getting FDA approvals. 3mm port. Pediatrics. JnJ, Stryker, Titan Medical, GE, have all tried with their massive market caps, and resources, to get their robots FDA approved to compete in this juicy market and only one has been able to do it.  So this competitor with a lower Market Cap, is a strong contender with strong alliances, that make it a massive sledge hammer for ISRG.

I highly suggest you watch the fireside between Cantor Fitzgerald and COO of competitor and how they talk about their essentially secured 510k, basically an upgrade to an already open cockpit design. VS how other competitors, from Europe, have been rejected:

I do think it ( $ISRG ) will tank, so that's why I'm posting on why I believe ISRG will bite the dust soon enough. And letting you guys know about it. It's a big thick juicy short, over 200 hundred bucks, close to 300 bucks a share. And short puts are relatively inexpensive right now. Not too inexpensive but still inexpensive in my book, very manageable price. My view is it took Tesla 17 years to become profitable in a multi competitor arena, there were several cars people could choose from. Here? there's ONLY TWO in the ENTIRE VAST MARKET of Surgeries, which all will be moving in some way shape or form to digitized, robotics. So either ISRG stops resting on it's monopolistic laurels or gets taken to the barn out back and shot, like Ford, GM, Chrysler/Stellantis has, by Tesla. Another fun fact: Toyota: It took them 26 years to become profitable. My point, This is LITERALLY a two man market. Competitor and ISRG. And one is lagging with tech and customer satisfaction and treatment, while the other is excelling.

I'll be editing the post as time goes by, with any further news or updates. I hope you guys pitch in too in the comments.

10,000 plus procedures have been performed worldwide by Senhances.

Please read. There are only 2 FDA apprvd Surgical Robots Put's Timeline: Late Mid 2024-2026 I am correlating this with Competitors release of their 2.0 version called Luna, more at very end of post, pics and timeline.

My Initial Position: Starting slow, looking for good deals. But I bought Jan 17th 2025 expiry PT of 95.00 for 1.20.

Im Buying/Bought $ISRG PUTS. Only Two Surgical Robots approved by the FDA. Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG enjoyed a literal monopoly for over two decades and just two years before pandemic worldwide pause, a second ever contender was FDA approved. Now it's post pandemic and it's on like Donkey Kong.

Intuitive and another one that is super low market cap, wsb bot won't let me post name without deleting my post, due to it's market cap. But it's interesting to note, that despite it's small market cap, it is completely DEBT FREE, and has powerful investors / board seat members, like Andrea Biffi, from SOFAR, an Italian pharma heavy weight, now MA'd(Merger Aquisitioned) by an even larger Pharma: Alfasigma, THE LARGEST Pharmaceutical company in Italy. So I wont name it. But I believe this small Market Cap contender will eventually cause ISRG to tumble and thus making ISRG a juicy short within the next year. It's close to 300 bucks right now. So I'm buying puts on ISRG.

Intuitive has super crappy technology vs recently FDA approved competitor. Competitor of Intuitive is less expensive. And has Re usable tools. Haptic Feedback for Surgeon. Eyetracking Camera. Google Cloud Healthcare AI and Nvidia partnership.

1. More on Google Health Care AI Cloud Colab, Competitor has had a formal collab since February of this year: Note what Ashima Gupta Global Director of Healthcare For Google AI Cloud said back then:

https://preview.redd.it/dipy098l2atb1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ceb8cc19072ffb131bdf3dc9bdbb578598fb2b2

2. Note what Director Said in Today's (10-9-23) Press Release to CNBC :

‚ÄúThese are the workflows that the physicians and nurses live by day in and day out. You can‚Äôt be adding friction to it,‚Äù Gupta told CNBC in an interview. ‚ÄúWe are very cautious of that ‚Äî that we are respecting the surface they use, that the workflow doesn‚Äôt change, but yet they get the power of this technology.‚Äù Link to today's press release: where quote is from:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html)

NOTE: The Hospitals that are part of Googles First Release for beta release ARE THE SAME HOSPITALS WITH SENHANCES Surgical Robots. Mayo Clinic and Hackensak. Please note that the Competitor is working to UPLOAD live video and picures and all kinds of DATASETS for AI and AI search for HEALTHCARE FIELD. Competitor has Senhances worldwide with over 10,000 procedures and like Tesla's record driver data and add it to Nueralink, the same happens with each Senhance that EACH SURGEON DRIVES, and Google / NVIDIA / Competitor are getting all Surgical Dataset gold. Very likely Google will pay Senhance creators a royalty to Competitor of ISRG. The fact is ISRG is flatfooted and will get rocked by this collab. When you see videos, links below, you will see Hackensack. And you will also see pic of Mayo Clinic Pediatrics anouncement a little over two weeks ago. See below for pics and links for further info/research/dd.

Intuitive Surgical / $ISRG eye gauges the poor hospitals and surgeons by requiring them to buy new tools every 5th, 10th, 12th, or MAX: 18th surgical procedure-depending on the tool robotic tip.  Yes you read that correct. EVERY 18th SURGICAL PROCEDURE. The bulk of their revenues comes from this obvious and  unsustainable eye gauging. Vs Competitor, whose tools are able to be re used indefinitely for life of tool. One Surgical Robot Surgeon mentioned they had been using the same tools from the Competitor for over 3 years!!Please google-I have links below-but you can google for yourselves also if you like:  Carlos Mendoza Herrera Master Surgeon from Cedar Sinai in Chicago. Also google = Amit Travedi , Hackensack Medical Hospital, Carlos Mendoza Herrera / Sinai Chicago, links below.

Notice picture=Also notice the open cockpit design of Competitor vs ISRG. ISRG surgical Robot Da  Vinci kills your peripheral view and forces you to hunch over, and you lose your clear line of sight of operating table and staff. Your head needs to go inside a hole in the machine.  Then you need to stare through two more holes. While on Senhance from Competitor, you keep a clear line of sight, sit comfortably upright and maintain a clear line of sight on operating table and staff. And stare a beautiful screen that's in front of you.

Competitor to ISRG currently has a formal Google Healthcare Cloud Agreement since February. And another formal agreement with juggernaut Nvidia, anounced much more recently-see pics below.

Mayo Clinic recently added the Competitors Surgical robot over Da Vinci becuase of all the aformentioned PLUS ISRG DOES NOT HAVE 3mm ports. In other words, 3mm is the literal size the robotic arms can cut to enter the thoracic cavity in order to operate. And so after surgical procedure, you don't have a foot long gaping wound stitched from which to heal from, but literally a 3mm cut. maybe like three 3mm cuts from which to heal from. An Inch is 25mm. To give you an idea of how small that is and how fast post operative healing can be especially for tiny infants that are a month old that can't handle 8mm or 12mm cuts the smallest ISRG has.

ISRG will take years to get FDA approval for a complete refresh to compete with an open cockpit design where the surgeon is upright looking at a screen. Also ISRG will take years to get 3mm approved and field pre clinically tested. Things the competitor ALREADY HAS FDA APPROVED AND IN THE MARKET AS THE MAYO CLINIC RECENTLY SHOWED. ISRG in their monopolistic comfort rested on it's laurels technology never bothered or cared to refresh their tech and upgrade, because they were the only game in town and never had to for over two decades so hospitals and doctors had to deal with what they ( $ISRG) gave them. Now they're caught flat footed.

\*A little deviation on what is Laparoscopy -and why Robotic Surgery is an evolution to that:

So the question I keep asking myself is WHY hasn't ISRG come up with 3mm port and a better open cockpit design in 23 years of their monopoly? Because they've never really needed to improve their lower tier tech, because there literally was NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAN THEM. This led to massive abuse on their part, more on that below, lawsuits and unhappy Hospitals and medical centers.

All robotic surgery crux is a minimally invasive surgery from smaller wounds you can heal from. so your up and running faster, with less pain, and can return to work, family, your routine in a much shorter time span than from an open surgery that leaves a massive wound maybe a foot long, that cuts through muscle, tendons, perhaps bones. Please see video links below for more explanation on this. They are short videos, like 2-5 minutes long. Laparoscopy was the MANUAL way of minimally invasive surgery, meaning an endoscopic camera gets placed inside your body, through a small incision and two tiny arms that are controlled manually, obviously this is a challenging form of surgery, but under skilled surgeons, extremely successful. With robotic surgery you have the steady hand, tremor free, you're able to sit down through out the process, and lessen the fatigue of hours long surgeries, ergo more successful, and safer surgeries, perhaps one after the other. Plus Software like no fly zones where the robot arm cannot extend and injure or maim a certain organ accidentally-something not avail with manual Laparascopy. Something ISRG does NOT have but Senhance does. See Lawsuits link below. Also measuring distances between organs, etc, can be done with software. VS inserting a phsyical sterilized ruler which was the way it was done before manually without the robotics-but still done with ISRG. Also articulated instruments inside the abdomen, add more dexterity with robotic surgical systems.  These are the advantages of Robotic Surgeriy over manual minimally invasive Laparoscopic surgeries. So robotic surgery is a level above manual laparascopy. Manaual Laparascopy was a level up from traditional open surgery.\*

Hospitals Fighting ISRG Monopoly

[https://www.axios.com/2021/07/13/hospitals-are-taking-on-a-surgical-robot-monopoly](https://www.axios.com/2021/07/13/hospitals-are-taking-on-a-surgical-robot-monopoly)

Here's an excerpt from above link, of the monopolistic bully tactics ISRG has used throughout the years to maintain their monopolistic revenues when you have had zero competition, ANY enterprise will earn substantial revenues  in a market with ZERO COMPETITION: ESPECIALLY FOR OVER TWO DECADES:  Excerpt, these are REAL LAWSUITS:

""**Driving the news:** In one allegation, a hospital says Intuitive Surgical remotely shut down a hospital's surgical robot ""in the middle of a procedure"" which forced the surgeon ""to convert the procedure to open surgery with the patient on the operating table,"" after the hospital said it was considering a service contract with a third party.""

Lawsuits:

[https://www.drugwatch.com/davinci-surgery/lawsuits/](https://www.drugwatch.com/davinci-surgery/lawsuits/)

""Many of the most recent da Vinci settlements have come from malpractice suits against surgeons. For example, in 2021, a 56-year-year old man received a $700,000 settlement after he sued his surgeon for cutting a hepatic duct during a da Vinci-assisted gallbladder procedure."" (Looks like this surgeon could have benefited from the No Fly Zone software Senhance has to AVOID robot arms accidentally harming interior organs during operation, that ISRG lacks)

[https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/new-concerns-on-robotic-surgeries/](https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/new-concerns-on-robotic-surgeries/)

Hospitals in Japan and Germany, and USA(Now the Mayo Clinic as of last week), using Senhance over Da Vinci. Why didn't the Mayo Clinic simply get another Da Vinci for their Pediatrics? Because Da Vinci lacks 3mm ports for small infants and children. Senhance has had recent Pediatric FDA approval.

Luna is the 2.0 from Competitor and will deal the final blow.

Based on Latest Cantor Fitzgerald Healthcare Expo, about a week ago, COO mentioned they had a clear 510 clearance for LUNA. The 2.0 iteration to Senhance.  Please note: Competitor has an excellent track record in getting FDA approvals. 3mm port. Pediatrics. JnJ, Stryker, Titan Medical, GE, have all tried with their massive market caps, and resources, to get their robots FDA approved to compete in this juicy market and only one has been able to do it.  So this competitor with a lower Market Cap, is a strong contender with strong alliances, that make it a massive sledge hammer for ISRG.

I highly suggest you watch the fireside between Cantor Fitzgerald and COO of competitor and how they talk about their essentially secured 510k, basically an upgrade to an already open cockpit design. VS how other competitors, from Europe, have been rejected:

1696893516.0,Rate my Theory on What is Currently Happening with the Fed,"Hi guys please rate my theory based on correctness and creativity:

The Fed is a highly incompetent speculator ape that incurred losses by quantitative easing / tightening, which led to money leaving its control and entering the economy. First it buys treasuries for 1 billion say, to increase money supply. If the value of the bonds falls before it sells it can only extract say 800 million back out of circulation by selling the bonds. 200 million have lost its control and are now in free circulation.

This results in current inflation. Now the fed has no mechanisms of extracting money because people love getting free/cheap money but hate giving money away, so the only valid option would be to actually pay tax money to the fed and let it destroy it. This is of course 200% politically infeasible.

Another idea they may have: The Fed might borrow money and therefore extract money from circulation, this is basically what it is currently doing by paying banks interest on reserves. They are currently incurring losses, because they have to pay moneyholders interest to convince them to extract the money from the circulation. This is done so the inflation that will come anyways is spread over a longer time period, so people aren't that angry at them. In the end the Fed is incapable removing their speculation losses from the circulation losses though, as all the money has owners now that won't willingly part with it. So it will all lead to inflation in due time, probably when the fed starts to gradually lower rates again and  all this stored up money is unloaded into the capital markets.

The interest paid to banks has to be paid by taxpayers / society. Feels good having to finance the Fed governors gambling.

1696882645.0,XBI Biotech ETF Short Squeeze,"This ETF is down almost 60% from its ATH. The biotech sector has been getting obliterated since early 2020 by rising interest rates (underperforming even the general small cap market) and FTC challenges to buyouts.

I understand that this sector is rate sensitive and the rising rates will of course have a negative impact on valuation. However it also seems like there is a heavy amount of manipulation here by institutional short sellers evidenced by the ridiculously high short interest. I understand the short selling mechanism is in place as a way to bet against companies and there is a legitimate reason to bet against biotech in this macro environment but when will shorts start covering? When rates start peaking and trending down? How is this level of shorting legal?

 negatively impacts stock prices.

2. Rising oil prices can put upward pressure on inflation, which may lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner.

Please look up the studies about the vaccine. There are a lot of studies.  
The Novavax vaccine is offering a good and long lasting protection with only mild side effects. It offers you a broad protection against many variants. 

What makes it so superior?

One part of the vaccine is the Matrix M adjuvant. The Matrix M is a new technology which wake up your immune system to produce the antibodies you need.

The WHO now recommends the new Malaria vaccine, which use the Matrix M adjuvant by Novavax. 

I think the company will have a bright future with more than one vaccine in their product line. 

Vaccine in the pipeline:

Influenza (qNIV) vaccine - Phase 3 in Progress

COVID-influenza combination (CIC) vaccine - Phase 1/2

Malaria vaccine R21 - Phase 2b in progress

The change of the CEO is a good thing too.

Upward pressure on oil, but not as much as people are making it sound. Oil already had an uptick due to supply changes -- supply and demand announcements will still control prices for oil, not this conflict.

Made a few tens of dollars and once I saw the potential I dropped $2500 into my brokerage and doubled it within 2 weeks. My portfolio was at 6k but I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the dollar amount. Next few days, I evaporated the profits. However, I wasn‚Äôt done.

In the beginning of the 2nd month I dropped 20 grand in my brokerage after realizing I need more capital to make a significant amount in this game. At this point, I kinda got the gist of options and majority of my setups/ predictions were hits. I started focusing on psychology. I knew from the start that this was a lot of people‚Äôs kryptonite so I binged Mark Douglas and other trading psychology videos. Slowly but surely I became profitable again(all time) on my portfolio with MSFT swings when they announced copilot 365 pricing.

Your biggest loss is always right after your biggest win. I knew I was about to snap these gains into nothingness but didn‚Äôt know what to do about it. I damn near lost it all in earnings plays. Literally all my earnings picks flopped‚Ä¶hard. NTFLX, TSLA, it almost felt targeted like the market was waiting on my next move.

From the day that I lost more than 10 bands in MSFT earnings, my account saw more reds than a Manchester United jersey. I‚Äôm talking BACK TO BACK red days. My account went from 30 grand to 10k in less than 2 WEEKS. I started trading 0DTEs to get my money back quickly‚Ä¶ no chance! The whole of August was‚Ä¶RED, the reversals were straight up ungodly. I was losing 50% of my portfolio with 6k in buying power. I wanted to experience what a tilt was sooner than later but I didn‚Äôt know it would last this long and demolish 95% of my portfolio. That 10k turned into 800 in the blink of an eye. My mental health was in the trenches but I knew this was part of the process. My portfolio was in shambles, so I had to reup with 10 bands. I decided to play NVIDIA straddles as my last card with earnings and what do you know? It also flopped.

Fast forward, September, I made consistent profits by scalping. Little profits, but profits regardless. My mentality was/ is break even is better than a red day. Last month I had only 4 red days and ended the month green, where each day was either break even or profit. My main goal was to not have any red days rather than make money.

However, this first week of October was just not my week. Stress and frustration got to me. Monday, my devices were lagging and I missed out on my play of the day. Then I rushed into something else and ended up having to scramble to break even when it should‚Äôve been an easy green day. Slightly worse on Tuesday, I caught the top of the market‚Äôs INSANE dump for puts but my order was rejected(for the first time ever) and I missed out. Barely slept for Wednesday and the same thing from Monday happened and I had to break even.

Thursday was just the perfect setup for what would happen on Friday. I made 1k first 2 hrs of market open and I started feeling that ‚Äúgains High‚Äù(y‚Äôall know what I‚Äôm talking about). As I was journaling my daily P/L I saw I could even out 1k gain to be a specific number like $1,100 instead of $1,080 or whatever I was about to journal üòÇ. So I quickly entered SPY 0dtes to make 20 bucks. 2hrs later, the 1k profit went down to 250. I usually trade weeklies, so I only ever use 0Dtes to make back money from a losing trade. I ended the day with one of the weirdest feelings I‚Äôve ever felt. I still felt high from the 1k win but ALSO a cloud of shock and disbelief that I gave 800 back trynna make 20 bucks. Come Friday(yesterday), I wasted absolutely no time to revenge trade. Entered Tesla & Nvda puts as early as I could. Decided to not only double down but more than quadruple down. Just seeing the money casually float away like a canoe to the horizon but I was too uneasy to help myself. My hope was that the last time I sold a losing trade 2 weeks ago, it went deep in the money and I would‚Äôve turned 400 to 15k. But all 3 of my strategies expired worthless.

Even though it‚Äôs hard to grip any handle of hope, I feel like I have to face the music at this point. My previous routine was scalping aggressively with a super tight stop loss of less than 1%. Even with my tight stop losses, Risking 60% of my port for 3% gain was simply not sustainable. What I need to do now is to be more selective and trade less AND still keep my stop loss. I refuse to let the market defeat me. I‚Äôm down $30,000+ but I still have 2500 to make that back. My biggest hurdle is ignoring my previous losses and treating this account like a brand new one. Making 300 a day is hard to appreciate when you know you‚Äôre down more than 30k. I might do monthly updates or just post when I make a million bucks depends on what y‚Äôall say in the comments lmao.

Thursday was just the perfect setup for what would happen on Friday. I made 1k first 2 hrs of market open and I started feeling that ‚Äúgains High‚Äù(y‚Äôall know what I‚Äôm talking about). As I was journaling my daily P/L I saw I could even out 1k gain to be a specific number like $1,100 instead of $1,080 or whatever I was about to journal üòÇ. So I quickly entered SPY 0dtes to make 20 bucks. 2hrs later, the 1k profit went down to 250. I usually trade weeklies, so I only ever use 0Dtes to make back money from a losing trade. I ended the day with one of the weirdest feelings I‚Äôve ever felt. I still felt high from the 1k win but ALSO a cloud of shock and disbelief that I gave 800 back trynna make 20 bucks. Come Friday(yesterday), I wasted absolutely no time to revenge trade. Entered Tesla & Nvda puts as early as I could. Decided to not only double down but more than quadruple down. Just seeing the money casually float away like a canoe to the horizon but I was too uneasy to help myself. My hope was that the last time I sold a losing trade 2 weeks ago, it went deep in the money and I would‚Äôve turned 400 to 15k. But all 3 of my strategies expired worthless.

Even though it‚Äôs hard to grip any handle of hope, I feel like I have to face the music at this point. My previous routine was scalping aggressively with a super tight stop loss of less than 1%. Even with my tight stop losses, Risking 60% of my port for 3% gain was simply not sustainable. What I need to do now is to be more selective and trade less AND still keep my stop loss. I refuse to let the market defeat me. I‚Äôm down $30,000+ but I still have 2500 to make that back. My biggest hurdle is ignoring my previous losses and treating this account like a brand new one. Making 300 a day is hard to appreciate when you know you‚Äôre down more than 30k. I might do monthly updates or just post when I make a million bucks depends on what y‚Äôall say in the comments lmao.


TLDR: Been trading for 5 months. Made $4,000 in one day in July and Went on tilt in August and lost 25k from earnings, 0DTE SPY & QQQ then revenge traded this week and lost 1.5 months of hard work."

1696693771.0,Why is $SAVE training at a near 90% Discount?,"Fellow regards

If you want to be a Millionaire, start with a billion dollars and launch a new airline. 

That might be true and investing in an airline, especially Spirit, may not sound like the best gamble but wait : 

As you may know Spirit Shareholders have accepted an all cash offer from JetBlue. The current share price is miles away from the agreed price. Also a dividend is paid monthly, returning near 7% p.a. at current levels. 

Here are the facts of the merger :
- A one time dividend cash payment of $2.50 per share for holders on record as of 9/12/22 was paid.

Starting 2023, a ticking fee of $.10 per share is paid monthly to shareholders as compensation for waiting for deal to close.

When deals closes, $JBLU will pay $33.50 less $2.50 less all applicable ticking fees - if deals closes.

If deal closes in January 2024 or thereafter, jblu will pay $34.15 less $2.50 less any ticking fees.

If deal falls through, jblu will pay $3.55/sh termination fee less 2.50 less ticking fees already paid (400M termination fee divided by 112.4M outstanding shares).


So where's the catch ? The DOJ is suing that merger. So far so good, my bets are against the FTC and the DOJ (see current MSFT/ATVI) but that's not the point. 

When the DOJ startet suing against the merger the deal was substantially different. The best shot the DOJ had was the 'northeast alliance'. This alliance between JetBlue and american is cancelled. Apart from that JetBlue has made lots of promises with gates and slots and whatever to hand to other ULCC airlines If the deal passes. 

The Trail should start at 10/16 and was prosponed for a week. That was anounced just 2 days after the pretrial conference between the DOJ and the airlines.  The judge said he will rule to the end of this year. 


So what's my thesis. The market thought the deal gets hammered from the DOJ but missed the substantial changes in the current year. 

That's said . What are you're thoughts ? Easy 90% or a regard telling BS.",wallstreetbets,"Why is $SAVE training at a near 90% Discount? Fellow regards

1696681655.0,Why Employment & Market Action Interactivity Is Changing,"A lot of posts and comments from last week were expressing concern & confusion about why there is an atypical relationship between unemployment being low, and the market responding positively, whereas this kind of thing would typically have been reversed in the past. I mentioned something about this in my post about your next 45 day plan while Congress contemplates & fights over the federal budget when I said many contractors also rely on the government for their revenue in every department. I said this might have a negative response in the market since people would not be able to reinvest any of their earnings in stock.

That is why I believe unemployment being low now could correlate to markets being further invested in since more people will have what they perceived to be income they can put to use. Or in the case of our speculation-driven projection-based economy, this may be getting ""priced in"" prematurely.

A good data point to remember is a report PEW put out in 2019, which said over 50% of Americans were invested in the market. Though I know of no new official report on this, it is obvious that the last 3 years pulled in more retail suckers than ever before in history. It could be 75% of Americans in the market now.

It used to be that fewer people in low income jobs intentionally bought into the market. But there is a famous story about some broker on Wall Street before the Great Depression I think is important to remember wherein he was getting his shoe shined and the shoe shine guy gave him a stock tip. That was when the broker knew it was oversold, and time to get out. 

Nobody these days knows what to invest in, since too few people even care about what is behind the stock or what they're doing. The elder class has been playing with no real overall losses for decades, convincing themselves they're smart, while the younger class is degenerate in their thinking. Due to this lack of creativity & capability on an individual basis, I'm sure it is going to be a lot of index funds getting pushed even more, despite them having no more legitimate underlying drivers of value. Bad news.

Whatever companies consider themselves to be good are too afraid to promote themselves since they think they must fall in line with a broader index-related point like artificial intelligence which could be too well undermined by any company going against that grain.

TLDR; more people having jobs used to mean more costs, decreasing perceived stock value. In today's market, too many people own stock, so if they are employed, they buy stock. This is not an inversion necessarily, but the market action of last wek may be explained in part by this phenomenon, and how the correction is going.",wallstreetbets,"Why Employment & Market Action Interactivity Is Changing A lot of posts and comments from last week were expressing concern & confusion about why there is an atypical relationship between unemployment being low, and the market responding positively, whereas this kind of thing would typically have been reversed in the past.

# Analyzing JOBY Aviation's Financial Odyssey: A Comprehensive Examination of Historical and Projected Data

#### Historical Financial Performance (FY-4 to Jun-23):

1. Revenue Conundrum:

* FY-4 to FY-1: Historical data is elusive, preventing a clear assessment of revenue trends. 

2. Troublesome Operational Metrics:

* EBITDA Hurdles: Over the last five quarters, JOBY has grappled with negative EBITDA, deepening from -$125 million to -$368 million in the most recent quarter (Mar-23).
* Adjusted EBIT: The adjusted EBIT paints a similarly troubling picture, culminating in a loss of -$216 million in Jun-23.

3. Balance Sheet Blues:

* Current Liabilities and Debt: Notably, short-term borrowings and the current portion of debt have witnessed an upward trajectory, reaching $4 million in Jun-23. This heightened financial leverage raises concerns about JOBY's ability to meet short-term obligations.
* Capital Leases: The presence of capital leases adds an additional layer of financial complexity, further intensifying JOBY's debt structure.

4. Capital Expenditure Crunch:

* CapEx Escalation: Capital expenditures have soared from $14 million in Mar-23 to a staggering $478 million in Jun-23, indicating aggressive spending plans that might strain cash flows.

# Further Considerations:

* Clouded Commercialization Path:

Joby Aviation's optimistic timeline for commercial launch, initially projected for late 2023 or 2024, now faces substantial delays. Recent developments suggest that a commercial launch may not materialize until 2025 or later, as outlined by the FAA's ""Innovate28"" plan. This prolonged timeline poses a significant risk to investor sentiment and erodes the company's competitive edge in the evolving eVTOL landscape.

* Financial Storm on the Horizon:

The financial outlook for Joby Aviation is mired in uncertainty, with cash burn and dilution surpassing initial estimates. Contrary to management's earlier expectations of ample cash until commercialization, the company's Q4 2021 Earnings Call indicates a delicate financial position. A $180 million stock offering in May, diluting shareholders by approximately 43.98 million shares, and a net debt of -$1.17 billion amplify concerns. Operating income of -$414.16 million for the last 12 months signals a growing cash burn, leaving the company with just over three years at its current rate.

* Macro Headwinds:

The macroeconomic backdrop further darkens Joby's prospects. Elevated interest rates, with short-term rates nearing 5.50% and a deeply inverted yield curve, raise funding costs for Joby's path to commercialization. This environment, coupled with a looming recession, adds to the risk profile of Joby's stock. Insider trading activities, including share sales by top executives, reflect a lack of confidence in the current market conditions.

* Challenging Market Dynamics:

Joby faces fierce competition, particularly from Archer (ACHR), in the North American eVTOL market, which is expected to represent half of the global market. Market research projections, albeit optimistic, suggest a market worth $14.17 billion by 2030. Joby's path to achieving a substantial market share, especially with competitors in Latin America, Europe, and China, remains uncertain.

# Unpacking JOBY's Bearish Saga: A Deep Dive into the Numbers

Brace yourselves as we delve further into the abyss, dissecting each number in my DCF model that tells a tale of caution:

https://preview.redd.it/y66owmw7tmsb1.png?width=2364&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd0f4823ad58214c9a597ad7561ffe17c20c3e7a

1. DCF Model: Unveiling the Valuation Quandary

* Fair Value Range: $1.31 to $1.84
* Market Price: $6.25
* Implied Downside: 70.6% to 72.0%

The crux of our bearish narrative lies in the stark discrepancy between the implied fair value and the market price. My DCF model suggests that JOBY might be significantly overvalued, prompting WSB traders to scrutinize their positions.

https://preview.redd.it/78u9ngddtmsb1.png?width=2028&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50211c58fff6272c0b0ed4a3a89b84dd9bfc606

2. Terminal EBITDA Multiples: The Earnings Conundrum

* Range: -37.6x to -35.6x

A negative EBITDA multiple is a glaring red flag, indicating that JOBY might face challenges in generating positive earnings in the foreseeable future. The steepness of the multiples implies a lack of investor confidence in JOBY's earnings potential.

3. Cash Flow Crisis: Decoding the Financial Projection

* EBITDA: (Dec '23) -$348 million to (Dec '27) -$68 million
* Free Cash Flow: (Dec '23) -$368 million to (Dec '27) -$546 million

JOBY's cash flow predicament is underscored by negative EBITDA and free cash flow projections. The dilution effect from the stock offering adds salt to the wound, raising concerns about the company's ability to sustain its operations.

4. Revenue and EBITDA CAGR: Gauging Growth Challenges

* Revenue 5Y CAGR: Not Meaningful
* EBITDA 5Y CAGR: -28.8%

The lack of a meaningful revenue growth projection coupled with a negative EBITDA CAGR signals potential hurdles in JOBY's growth trajectory. The aviation industry is competitive, and JOBY seems to face an uphill battle.

5. Competitive Landscape: Navigating Growth Challenges

* Market Competition: Archer (ACHR) and other eVTOL contenders
* Revenue and EBITDA Projections: Signal potential struggle for profitability

JOBY's market competitors are fierce, and the financial projections indicate a challenging road to profitability. The 5-year CAGR figures reflect a company grappling with growth challenges in a competitive market.

6. Regulatory and Macroeconomic Headwinds: External Forces at Play

* Regulatory Hurdles: Potential impediment to market entry
* Macroeconomic Challenges: Unpredictable economic conditions

External factors, such as regulatory challenges and macroeconomic uncertainties, add complexity to JOBY's journey. The ability to navigate these external forces will be critical for sustained success.

7. Recap of DCF Model: An Investor's Alarm Bell

* Implied Fair Value: $1.75 to $1.84
* Implied Upside / (Downside): -70.6% to -72.0%

So  my theory is, the oil was at ATH the last month or so, just slightly  corrected down recently. In my opinion the price is not sustainable, gas  everywhere is more expensive than ever and demand is falling due to  this. The society is learning how to use less oil in general. Plus  russia is in need of cash and will have in the future to ramp back up  the production IMHO

I already  cashed in with this week down correction, but i see the trend going back  down to 70ish dollars, and if instead the trend is going back up at 90+  usd a barrel i will only lose 10-15% but i can hold my bet and wait few  months until the price comes back down and get my money back.

[https://imgur.com/a/zXXZQHp](https://imgur.com/a/zXXZQHp)

Sick of you fucking zoomer newf\*\*\* mouthing off about the world ending when you don't even have any positions. Here are mine: 18 $370 puts QQQ 1/19/24, and 15 $370 puts QQQ 6/21/24. It doesn't quite add up to $70k anymore because today has been a right shit day sitting on a giant green nail attached to the mechanical bull I'm riding.

Here is a list of reasons the QQQ will soon be known as the river of tears ""Q\_Q fucking Q"", in no particular order:

1. Essentially back at all time highs, as if the beerflu tech bubble never popped. It didn't make sense back then when interest rates were zero and there wasn't anything else to buy, and it is pants on head regarded right now.

2. Interest rates are back to normal levels, which after the 2007 financial crisis, means they are astronomically high and no one who survived the last fifteen years of ""buy every dip"" investing remembers what the fuck it means when fixed income is making more of a return than equities.

3. Bond yields are going to keep going up. I had TLT puts until Monday and sold them for a nice profit, wish I kept them for Tuesday too but oh well. I'm fucking terrified of bear market rallies but that's also why I still have money. 5% on the long end is not the top, it's just a temporary stop even if they go down for a bit. The deficit is around 4% of GDP, there is not even enough discretionary spending to balance the budget anymore, and military/social security/medicare are not going to be cut by a third. The deficits will continue and that means inflation will continue at the same rate since it will all be paid for by issuing debt that will be bought by the money printer. Eventually bond buyers will decide they aren't getting paid enough for inflation and yields will go into a death spiral until we decide to scuttle aircraft carriers and let Gam Gam starve. On top of this no one is buying bonds anymore except speculators, and they're going to eventually have to cover (sell) to end the bleeding. Foreigners are selling either because they need the money (Japan) or they don't want to write off their holdings when they get sanctioned (China). Oil princes also don't need to buy treasuries as much when they aren't selling oil only in dollars anymore. Yes I know bonds are worth less than half of what they were recently, but they can go down another half if yields go up to 7.5% from 5%.

4. Tech stocks are grossly overvalued right now. QQQ current P/E is 30, their forward P/E is 26. SPY is about 19 for both. EPS in tech are going down this earnings season, not up like people think. Here's some helmet math, at current P/E, EPS has to go up 50% just to match the current 10 year yield. At 7.5% it will need to go up 125%. Expectations are for something like 15% EPS growth this quarter, but every company is going to be guiding down and some may guide losses. Tesla is cutting prices, NVIDIA is going to see a slowdown in orders, Apple is going to start seeing a global decline for the first time, Facebook is just going to lose money as advertisers cut budgets, Amazon and Google are going to see regulatory threats to break them up and eliminate their network advantages. Microsoft will tread water. AI is a fucking joke and a huge compliance risk to any corporate business. My 1/19/24 puts are for this play. At some point I'll make them into spreads when earnings get priced in.

5. Economics 101 is that trade raises net prosperity. The last thirty plus years of wealth has been driven in very large part by globalization. Your grandpa might have lost that sweet factory job but all your cheap toys came from China. Get used to whittling wooden toys again for your own kids because that's about all you'll be able to afford in consumer goods. At least you'll be able to find a job to buy locally grown beans and a locally built piece of shit Chevy, though. Deglobalization is going to drive prices through the roof and that's going to keep fueling inflation. If you think semiconductors are expensive now, wait until China puts a blockade on Taiwan because if they can't have semis, no one can. My long term 6/21/24 put spreads are for long term trends. I have $330 puts sold against these and I'm going to keep selling far out of the money monthly spreads on these to stay theta positive.

1696617539.0,"BYND Meat, my short Thesis","TL:DR The company is overvalued.

Beyond Meat, for those who do not know, is an company that makes vegetable based burgers.  The patties taste fine, IMO, but nothing to write home about.

The business however, is a dumpster fire.

First, they barely have a gross margin. (around 2-3%).

They sold a billion in convertible bonds at 0% interest with an imbedded call option.  That option is at around 206 per share, which I would call OTM.

Basically the company has until March 2027 to figure it out, and in the interim it is burning 40-50 million a quarter, with 210 million in unrestricted cash on it's balance sheet.

How to value this company?  You can take a page out of Aswath Damodaran's playbook and value the equity as a call option on the company's assets being larger than the liabilities at the debt bomb date (March 2027).  His website has a model called ""equity"" where you can plug in numbers and get a value for the equity.

Here's what the spreadsheet looks like for those who are interested.

Here are my assumptions: risk free rate 5%, value of assets 968 million, value of debt 1.2 billion, I assume a std of return on assets to be 31% (average for food wholesaler).  Length of Option I put in as 3.5 years (or about the length of time between now and March 2027).  I get a value of equity to be 200 million.  


If you think the option time-period is actually 4 quarters, figuring after they announce in November they only have 4 quarters of spend left, you get 58 million.  Those convert to 3.15 dollars a share and 90c per share.

Beyond Meat, for those who do not know, is an company that makes vegetable based burgers.  The patties taste fine, IMO, but nothing to write home about.

The business however, is a dumpster fire.

First, they barely have a gross margin. (around 2-3%).

Enter Level 6 options, where the thrill of the trade is turned up to 11, conjuring trades so wildly complex they‚Äôd make Ackman‚Äôs head spin.

Crypto has recently stolen the trophy for risk, and it's about time options kicked it up a notch too. 

Here are a few potential trades:


_______________________________________________________________
Trade 1: Time-Dilated Synthetic Leverage (TDSL) Option

In the first instance, consider the Time-Dilated Synthetic Leverage (TDSL) Option, where a trader takes a synthetic, uncovered short position on a stock, let's say Company A, utilizing excessive leverage to amplify potential gains (and losses). Here, the TDSL is not solely tethered to Company A's direct performance but algorithmically links to an array of correlated and inversely correlated assets, globally distributed.

Time-Shifted Assets: The short position is not bound by conventional temporal constraints but is algorithmically adjusted to account for simultaneous global market movements, adapting in real-time to different time zones and market conditions, thereby exposing the trader to global systemic risks.

Algorithmic Strike Price: The strike price of the option dynamically shifts based on predictive algorithms which forecast not only asset price movements but also geopolitical and macroeconomic events, introducing an additional layer of speculative risk.

_______________________________________________________________

Trade 2: Multi-Stratum Correlated Asset Vortex (MSCAV) Option

In the second theoretical trade, the Multi-Stratum Correlated Asset Vortex (MSCAV) Option, a trader melds a plethora of uncovered short positions on an assortment of stocks, bonds, and commodities into a singular trade entity, amalgamating disparate market segments into a vortex of interconnected risks and potentials.

Dynamic Leverage Flux: Each individual asset within the MSCAV operates on a dynamically adjusted leverage, autonomously altering its risk profile based on real-time asset performance, volatility indices, and global economic indicators.
Uncovered Synergy: Instead of individual performance dictating outcome, each asset‚Äôs performance influences the others‚Äô position size and leverage, creating a symbiotic risk-reward paradigm, where the downfall or uplift of one asset intricately impacts the entirety of the MSCAV option.

______________________________________________________________


Trade 3: The Quadratic Leverage Matrix (QLM) Option:

The QLM Option initially leverages a position in a primary asset (e.g., a high-cap technology stock) via a quadratic function, wherein the leverage factor dynamically escalates in proportion to the square of the asset‚Äôs price movement. This initiates a condition whereby the financial exposure exponentially intensifies relative to the asset‚Äôs price volatility, creating a hyperbolically enhanced risk/reward scenario.

Subsequently, a secondary layer of complexity is introduced through a matrix of derivative assets (e.g., options on various commodities, currencies, and bonds), each independently and linearly leveraged. However, their collective leverage matrix is intrinsically entangled with the quadratic leverage applied to the primary asset, resulting in a convoluted multi-layered interaction that uniquely amplifies financial outcomes. Specifically, the gains or losses of the derivative matrix affect the primary asset's quadratic leverage coefficient, rendering the resultant financial impact a product of interactions within a high-dimensional financial space.

Moreover, a conditional layer is assimilated via algorithmic logic, which modifies leverage parameters based upon external economic indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation, across multiple economies. This introduces an adaptive characteristic to the QLM Option, where its structural risk-profile evolves in tandem with global economic paradigms, further compounding its inherent complexity and speculative nature.

1696564266.0,$Root Insurance: Buckle Up for a Potential 10x Return in 3 Years! üöÄ,"Hey fellow WallStreetBets enthusiasts,

I've got some exciting news to share about Root Insurance (ROOT). While it's had its fair share of tough days, it looks like the winds are shifting in their favor, and the future is looking brighter than ever.

**Recent Positives:**

* üìà **App Store Ranking Surge:** Root's app has been on fire, climbing from a dismal 200+ to a solid 67 in the finance sector. This speaks volumes about their growing user base and engagement.
* ü§ù **New Partnerships:** Root Insurance isn't just sitting idly by; they've locked in three new partnerships for embedded insurance. These collaborations are poised to boost their market presence and revenue streams.
* üí∞ **Healthy Cash Position:** With a robust cash reserve of $520 million and liabilities at $250 million, Root is in a strong financial position to fuel its expansion plans.

**The Future Looks Bright:** Root Insurance is positioning itself for success in the coming years. Here's why you should consider placing your bets on this one:

&#x200B;

* **Breakeven in 2024:** Root's financials indicate a path to profitability, with breakeven projected in 2024.
* Estimating a **20% Growth from 2025:** With current revenues at $750 million run rate and more partnerships in pipeline. 
* **Profit Potential:** The 70% loss ratio is almost best in class, which could translate to profits of between $50 to $100 million in 2025 on a revenue of 800 to 900 million. Which looks easy.
* **Potential Valuation:** At a multiple of 15 P/E, Root's estimated valuation by end of 2025 could soar to a staggering $1.125 billion, which is a jaw-dropping 10x increase from its current valuation of 125 million.

Now, I don't know about you, but the prospect of a 10x return in just three years sounds like a WallStreetBets dream come true. Root Insurance is showing all the signs of a company on the rise, and with its current valuation, it's a high-risk, high-reward play that could pay off handsomely.

What are your thoughts on Root Insurance? Let's discuss in the comments below. üöÄüí∞

1696539721.0,Top 10 Reasons why Cinemark doesn‚Äôt need Taylor Swift to be the next great value play.,"  

1. Movie theaters don‚Äôt need Taylor Swift ‚Äì but she‚Äôs not hurting them either. The upcoming ‚ÄúTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour‚Äù is setting domestic presale records with demand 10 times higher than any other event film CNK has exhibited.  The ""Eras Tour"" movie releases on October 15th. And jumping on the band-wagon, Beyonce‚Äôs movie tour is now scheduled for December release.

2. The domestic box office is quietly rebounding and trending just under 20% pre-pandemic totals and yet the market is completely missing the fact that the 2nd largest theater operator (CNK) is still trading 60% below pre pandemic stock price.

3. CNK is deeply undervalued at just under $19 ‚Äì even though it‚Äôs up 116% year to date as the market has begun to recognize its mistake.

4. Movie theaters historically perform better during down markets ‚Äì people like escapism. Just look at the results the last 30 days ‚Äì CNK up 11% and S&P down 5%.  And there's a good chance there will be a lot of escapism happening in the next 12-18 months.

5. AMC gets all of the meme-stock attention, but CNK is a much better run cinema company with a stronger balance sheet and management team ‚Äì markets often reward steady and conservative leadership over time ‚Äì in the last 12 months CNK is up 52% and AMC is down 89%.

6. CNK has the highest YoY growth of all theater operators since the pandemic reopening

7. With the Writers‚Äô strike finally over, the framework is now in place for the SAG negotiations, which will dramatically improve the outlook for 2024 and beyond.

8. Speaking of overlooked factoid ‚Äì did I mention CNK‚Äôs short interest float is current trading at 23%. Whoever is betting against this company has had a really bad year, and it's going to get worse.

9. Just imagine what happens if AMC were to file bankruptcy? CNK would be in the best position to pick up market share and some of AMC's best locations at a fraction of the cost.

10. I'm confident CNK is about to report a very healthy Q3 report after the unexpected windfall of Barbenheimer. Everyone thought Tom Cruise was going to carry the summer again. Who would have thought he would get out gunned by the atomic bomb and Barbie by a mile.

1696533633.0,"First Hawaiian, Inc. signs to buy FHB"," okay ill make it short

If we don't consider the COVID dip, the bank has generally maintained a solid average price of approximately $26 in recent times. However, the stock is currently only at 50% of its former stable price. The reasons for this are the higher loans and market difficulties affecting banks in general, leading many investors to remove FHB from their portfolios. Due to this short attack, the price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and EV-to-EBITDA ratios have all become very low.

Despite these challenges, there is also a declining revenue trend in the banking sector's future. While this may seem like a reason to sell, this bank is not worth $17, firstly, based on the low metrics, but also because the bank stands out from the crowd. It has maintained a positive cash flow for years, with increasing revenue, especially in the last year, and a confident dividend yield. Furthermore, they have minimal debt, which positions the company far from bankruptcy. The company has also set a price target of $20 by the end of the year.

All of this sounds promising, but the reason I believe the company will attract investors with positive numbers in the near future is because the bank's recent investments, made in the last few quarters, are expected to generate around $4 billion in revenue. The bank itself stated in an interview that they usually get a 150% return on their investments. This means that in the next few quarters, earning $6 billion is quite possible, which should help rectify the current price fluctuations.

In conclusion, I believe FHB is a good company that is currently influenced by the current bull market trends. Cheers!",wallstreetbets,"First Hawaiian, Inc. signs to buy FHB  okay ill make it short

Sup Sluts,

Well, Reddit refuses to allow me to publish my tinfoil conspracies about stuff, but I guess I could spend my friday night talking about Disney and how I much I fucking hate this stock and give an update to my previous post almost a year ago that ""Bob Iger Ain't Savin Shit"". They say don't fuck with the mouse, and seriously... Don't fuck with it. It's a waste of time. I am posting this not as DD, though it could be. I'm drunk and just felt like ranting and having something I could link to everytim I hear some knuckle head say ""but the stock is so low, it can't go lower!""

# TL;DR

 I believe that Disney will continue flat through January as they cut their market cap and assets down to pay off comcast, and in about February will have their executive and creative team replaced by people that want to be efficient.

# Bearish:

# 1. HULU

Disney is in hot water still, and there are many reasons why I still have a sell rating in the $LUT ETF. The first thing is that they have an agreement with Comcast that has been totally torn to shreds over their partnership with HULU. Disney owns 66% and Comcast own 33% of HULU however, Comcast is pulling out and demands to be paid the 33%.  Disney doesn't have the money. So you can see why Iger is [Having a fire sale](https://nypost.com/2023/09/15/abc-news-staffers-freaking-the-f-k-out-over-sale-rumors-despite-pushback-from-disney/) on their assets.

All the money they make from selling their shit off is already fucking spent on HULU. So, if you hear some asshole on CNBC saying that Disney is going cash, it's a lie.

**AT LEAST** **27.5 billion**

Why is this bolded? well, because comcast disagrees on the valuation of HULU. As the ancient scrolls of the contract fortold, in the event of comcast selling their portion, this is the lowest valuation that they can get. HULU is worth much more that the 90 Billion that Disney is claiming it is worth (at time of contract). It has gotten more expensive because it actually makes money. However, like a rat in a trap there is a catch 22. Disney wants a low as possible evalutation and Comcast wants a ""high as Walt Disney in his 20's"" valuation. However, any devaluation of the streaming service will affect the valuation of disney+ by analysts that are comparing the two services.

>‚ÄúWe are excited to get this resolved,‚Äù Roberts said Wednesday at Goldman Sachs‚Äô Communacopia and Technology conference. ‚ÄúAnd the minimum $27.5 billion that people have bandied about, that was a hypothetical that we picked five years ago because Disney has control of the company. The company is way more valuable today than it was then. ‚Äù

No matter what, Disney will lose.

# 2. Disney+

It sucks. losing subscribers every quarter. It's a graveyard for their IPs...

# 3. IP exhaustion

The IPs that they bought that originally boosted their stock under Iger have been totally depleted. Who the fuck is Echo? Who the fuck is Ahsoka? Who the fuck is this Indiana Jones girl? Both the Marvel franchise and Lucas Arts Franchises are scraping the bottom of the barrel for original charachters to milk. It's over y'all. Every fan favorite charachter that has been pre-tested through books, shows, comic books has been tapped. The way disney sky rocketed is by taking prewritten stories drafted into scipts and having their corpses revived and danced around in live action with a lil subversion to keep things interesting. The writers don't have the creativity it takes (or balls) to make orginial IPs and shows and make an entire production out of them.

They have more misses than hits recently, and there are a ton of right wingish videos on the internet that can detail the cost to profit for these extremely overblown budget movies and shows.

# 4. Florida

They called what they couldn't kill getting involved in Florida politics. Governor has told them to retract any lawsuits because they just won't win. It's a them park dude; not the Vatican.

However, I am seeing a light at the end of the tunnel for the first time since the stock started falling.

# Bullish:

# 1. Force Majuere

*Force majeure* translates literally from French as *superior force.* In modern times, it means contract cancellation due to extreme conditions outside of the control of the overseeing body. I am talking about the writer (and actor) strike. Disney has an oppurtunity here to flush out the losers and parasites that have allowed the body of Mickey to be overrun with worms.

[Iger getting less Woke (sleepy)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/disney-ceo-bob-iger-vows-to-quiet-the-noise-in-culture-wars/ar-AA1h46je)

He has promised investors to shift away from agenda driven projects and go back to entertainment. Funny what losing money does to a mofo.

The queen parasite is Kathleen Kennedy who must know where bodies are buried to keep working at Disney, however, there are rumors that she is retiring soon. She is responsible for pretty much everything bad (according to deep star wars fans)

# 2. AI

The arts and writing department are under serious threat of AI aided computer graphics and script writing. I fucking hate machines worse than Neo, but if it can detect plot holes and write cohesive scripts, I think a truce can be made.  I don't give a flying fuck what you've heard about the writer strike coming to amicable terms.  AI will be used.  AI will significantly reduce the amount of script writers and animators and allow more junk to be pumped out cheap, which is what Disney ultimately needs because....

# 3. History Rhymes

This isn't the first time there has been a bubble in movie productions. In the mid-50s to 60's there were extravagent sets and high cost movie productions to try and make the most electrifying movies ever. Movies kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger until they crashed into the 70's and then we got smaller budget character-driven movies, which then led to the renaissance of the 80's action movies. What we are seeing now is the toppling of the 300+ million dollar production clashing with the shoestring budget of smaller (mostly horror) films. These large productions with lazy fat lethargic spoiled staff is coming to an end, and I think Disney knows that. They have been telegraphing their intent on making cheaper movies.

&#x200B;

Finally, Disney is trimming the fat out of absolute last minute neccessity and I couldn't be happier. Get hungry staff to replace those resting on their laurels and lets tell some stories with magic again to make the children happy. Soon, but not yet.

**The stock is currently sitting where it should**; pre-marvel, pre-lucas, pre-disney+. It is surviving off of cruises and parks which are a non-speculative portion of their market cap, but even that isn't looking great as the park goers keep getting villianized and pissed at executives.

Well, it may not be an original idea, but getting kids hooked early is how you make a sustainable company.  I expect now that super hero movies and Star Wars have been bled dry, we will see movies of large bets gone right, and ""remember the titans"" type shit.  I don't really know much about this, so go ahead and fill in the blanks for me.

He has promised investors to shift away from agenda driven projects and go back to entertainment. Funny what losing money does to a mofo.

The queen parasite is Kathleen Kennedy who must know where bodies are buried to keep working at Disney, however, there are rumors that she is retiring soon. She is responsible for pretty much everything bad (according to deep star wars fans)

# 2. AI

The arts and writing department are under serious threat of AI aided computer graphics and script writing. I fucking hate machines worse than Neo, but if it can detect plot holes and write cohesive scripts, I think a truce can be made.  I don't give a flying fuck what you've heard about the writer strike coming to amicable terms.  AI will be used.  AI will significantly reduce the amount of script writers and animators and allow more junk to be pumped out cheap, which is what Disney ultimately needs because....

# 3. History Rhymes

This isn't the first time there has been a bubble in movie productions. In the mid-50s to 60's there were extravagent sets and high cost movie productions to try and make the most electrifying movies ever. Movies kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger until they crashed into the 70's and then we got smaller budget character-driven movies, which then led to the renaissance of the 80's action movies. What we are seeing now is the toppling of the 300+ million dollar production clashing with the shoestring budget of smaller (mostly horror) films. These large productions with lazy fat lethargic spoiled staff is coming to an end, and I think Disney knows that. They have been telegraphing their intent on making cheaper movies.

&#x200B;

Finally, Disney is trimming the fat out of absolute last minute neccessity and I couldn't be happier. Get hungry staff to replace those resting on their laurels and lets tell some stories with magic again to make the children happy. Soon, but not yet.

**The stock is currently sitting where it should**; pre-marvel, pre-lucas, pre-disney+. It is surviving off of cruises and parks which are a non-speculative portion of their market cap, but even that isn't looking great as the park goers keep getting villianized and pissed at executives.

# Final Thoughts

I really could go on, but I think I have reached everyone's attention span.  I could post it as with a DD flair, but I will leave it as a discussion because I don't have positions or price target BECAUSE THIS STOCK IS GOING NOWHERE. It is worthless until a C-Suite execution and massive purge and pivot, and I have been saying this for a while.  I know how some of you love your DIS, but face the reality.   "

Hey everyone, just a reminder that a stock market correction is coming the likes of which we haven‚Äôt seen in almost a century. No I‚Äôm not a doomsdayer, it‚Äôs all very logical and rooted in fact and history. So for those of you that are capable of critical thought outside of your preconceived ideas. Please continue to read on and allow me to elaborate.

1. Long term debt cycle - yes I have read Ray Dalio, the changing world order. And yes he is correct. We are nearing the end of the long term debt cycle, we are currently in the money printing / excessive credit phase. 

2. Enormous U.S. debt - yes the United States is currently sitting on 33 trillion of national debt. An all time high, and still climbing at a ridiculous rate that is unsustainable. This will lead to a debt crisis, forced government spending cuts, and likely civil unrest.

3. Rate hikes - interest rate hikes have not yet been fully felt in the economy. Despite what the talking heads might be saying. Consumer / government debt loads are at an all time high. And insolvency rates are also rapidly climbing. 

4. QT - quantitative tightening, the fed is sucking money out of the economy at an alarming rate (see M2 money supply) .. this coupled with the problems detailed above will create liquidity problem for banks. Which in turn will affect loans and credit availability for consumers 

5. Complacency - we are in that beautiful sweet spot where people desperately want to believe everything is going to be ok. And they will believe anything that reinforces that idea. Zero interest rates and excessive debt loads have created a time bomb for both governments and consumers. And it‚Äôs about to go üí• boom! 

You don‚Äôt believe me? That‚Äôs fine, part of me hopes I‚Äôm wrong too honestly. But attached are my PUT positions for SPY and SCHW Let‚Äôs see how I do.

As MIT review states, Gogoro revolutionizes the electric scooter industry with a smart battery-swapping network. Unlike Tesla, Gogoro sells scooters to drive demand for its swapping stations. They manufacture scooters and batteries, with their batteries used by Yamaha and Suzuki. Gogoro's network comprises 13,000 smart stations across nine countries, enabling around 400,000 daily battery swaps.

Full MIT Technology Review (10/5/2023):  
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080115/2023-climate-tech-companies-gogoro-electric-vehicles-scooter-battery-pack-network/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080115/2023-climate-tech-companies-gogoro-electric-vehicles-scooter-battery-pack-network/)

The product is amazing and much better than any other battery swapping system in the market. Userbase in Taiwan is already over 550k riders (and growing).  For a subscription that starts at about $20 per month, its customers can exchange batteries from their scooters as often as they need.

Some of you might remember Gogoro as SPAC company that had big plans for international expansion. The initial plans didn't move forward as expected but things are about to change so it might be a good time to take another look at this company.

**International expansion**

The key challenges for international expansion have been:  
A) Reaching competitive pricing for batteries, battery swapping stations and scooters in international marks such as India and Philippines.  
B) Ensuring government subsidies.  
C) Finding good local partners.  
It has required a lot of preparation work but it seems that they are making a great progress.

1. They ensured significant subsidies from Maharashtra government in India (1.5 billion dollar deal for 8 years).
2. They will start building swapping stations and batteries locally in India. It will reduce the costs about 20-30%. Combined with subsidies it has a significant impact to the cost of building the battery swapping network and scooters.
3. They are about to launch locally in India manufactured price competitive scooter in Q4/2023 and other products in the coming quarters. Those products are targeted to India and other markets. It should attract price concious B2B companies and consumers. Other highend products are also in the pipeline for less price sensitive users.
4. The initial focus group in India is B2B sector for last mile deliveries. It's a huge business with millions of scooters. So, they can sell to couple of selected customers tens of thousands of price competitive scooters and extend the battery swapping network as there is already a base demand. They have already announced multiple high profile partnerships.
5. When the core network in India has extended enough then they will start selling to consumers. However, they are also working with partner brands who are interested to build and launch their own PBGN scooters as the swapping network has extended. This would cause a positive cycle in demand to extend the swapping network even further.
6. They have a great partner in Philippines (Globe). Public launch is about to happen in Q4/2023.
7. Their partner in South Korea (BikeBank) is about to make a public launch in Q4/2023.

I think that the biggest reasons for slow international expansion have been the pricing and subsidies. Gogoro had to wait until they get their product line up and running in India (it's happening in Q4). It has been important to wait for the manufacturing line build up until the subsidies have been confirmed. Now things look promising so it will be interesting to hear what they will say in Q3 investors call. In the last Q2 call they indicated that they will tell more about 2024 forecast which is expected to be substantial.

**Taiwan update**

Gogoro is dominating Taiwan's EV market with 73.8% market share (over 80% if PBGN partners are included).

ICE makers have a price war ongoing in Taiwan and therefore many consumers are attracted to cheap prices. This has impacted to the overall sales of EVs in Taiwan but not to Gogoro's marketshare in EVs. ICE price discount are an effort from Kymco to regain their ICE market share and eventually the discounts will be over. It's also good to keep in mind that government goal is to expand EV usage from 12% in 2023 to 35% in 2030 and eventually to 100% in 2040. It's obvious that government will make this happen.

**Gogoro share**

The market cap is only  **620M** and it seems that international expansion is not priced in. It's always difficult to know when to jump onboard in the investment as Tesla shareholders know. However, according to MIT Technology Review it's good to keep an eye on this company. Sustainability megatrend is strongly supporting Gogoro's business and they have a fair chance to multiply their revenue in the new markets.

The S&P 500 finished Tuesday‚Äôs session sharply lower as the bond market‚Äôs outlook dims.

This isn‚Äôt the trade I‚Äôve been waiting for. Luckily, my trading plan is keeping me on the right side of the market. As I wrote Monday evening:

>*I am not a bear by any stretch of the imagination, but if this market is going to bounce, it needs to happen soon. I will buy back in if prices bounce on Tuesday, but I need to see constructive price action first. Until then, I‚Äôm sitting on my hands and watching this from the safety of the sidelines. (Aggressive traders can short another breakdown.)*

As readers know, I tried buying a couple of bounces over the last few weeks, and with hindsight being 20/20, obviously, those trades didn‚Äôt work as expected. Fortunately, those failed trades didn‚Äôt cost me any money because I bought the bounces early and was able to quickly move my stops up to my entry points. As I‚Äôve written countless times, low-risk/high-reward trades are always worth trying, even when they don‚Äôt pay off.

I suppose I could have been bearish and profited more from this decline, but optimists amass far more money than pessimists because the market spends significantly more time going up than going down. If I‚Äôm going to error, it will always be buying the bounce because those work far more often than betting on a bigger breakdown that only occurs once every couple of years. As much as the Bears are boasting right now, they‚Äôve been wrong all year. When it comes to trading, I‚Äôd much rather be right for 11 months instead of just one.

All of that said, stocks are only down 8% from their 52-week highs, so this still qualifies as a pretty vanilla step-back and something that happens once every year or two. Of course, the alternative interpretation is stocks have ‚Äúonly‚Äù fallen 8%, meaning there is a lot more downside if we are truly falling into a bear market.

Are we close to the bottom, or not even halfway? That‚Äôs the million-dollar question. But as nimble and savvy traders, it doesn‚Äôt matter. We get out of the way when prices fall, and we buy back in when prices bounce. In fact, the lower prices go now, the more money we make riding the next wave higher, so bring on more selling!

The S&P 500 is quickly approaching 4,200 support and the 200 dma. No matter what the future holds, we should expect at least a modest bounce at these widely followed technical levels. Maybe we violate these levels a few days later, but over the next day or two, the odds are good prices will bounce, making this the wrong place to be aggressively pressing shorts.

Wait for the bounce, then follow the market‚Äôs lead. Either the bounce will stick, or it won‚Äôt. Savvy traders will be basing their next trade on what happens after 4,200.

1696443234.0,For all the regards who have no clue what's all this Bonds and Yields talk driving the markets,"Listen up regards, here is some quick 101 for you who don't have slightest clue what's driving the markets and why we are seeing all this news suddenly on Bonds and Yields:

- **Fed led by Papa pow printed a lot of money during Covid.. like a fuck ton of money and used it to buy US Treasury securities** like (T-bills, T-bonds and T-notes). These are debt instruments on which US Government will pay them interest.

- Post-pandemic we got hit by **Inflation that turned out to be not so transitory** due to Covid supply shocks (including factory closures), Russia invading Ukraine, Above mentioned money printing that was given as aid to US citizens and a host of other factors.

- **Fed has only one tool in its toolbox to tame Inflation.. Higher interest rates.** It hiked from near 0% to 5% in a matter of 18 months. Practically unheard of in modern history. The previous hike in rates like this was done by Fed chair Paul Volcker.. the guy with the balls so strong and heavey, he had to weigh them using a truck scale. Seriously, search him on Google.

- Higher rates mean the previous bonds sold with lower interest rate lose value. If US treasury sells a bond that pays 1% interest for 10 years with $100 face value, and then due to higher interest rate US treasury sells you another note that pays 2% interest for 10 years with $100 face value, the previous note that pays lower interest goes down in value due to higher interest rates on the newer treasuries. So the **return a bond gives a.k.a Yield goes higher when the bond prices go down and vice versa.**

- Fed hiking rates and keeping them higher for longer mean **bond traders** are fearing the higher rates for longer and selling off 10 year US treasury securities. **Japanese institutional investors** are selling US treasury securities, **Fed themselves** are selling Treasury securities that they purchased during Covid to reduce size of their balance sheet and **US Government is also selling US Treasury securities** in open market to fund debt.

- **This has caused 10 Year US treasury Yields to spike and hence any debt including Corporate bonds, Mortgages etc. will have to be funded using higher interest rates restricting growth of economy. Corporate Bonds are also having a major selling off due to higher yields. Higher yields also signal higher interest rates which mean Present value of future earnings goes down. Stocks are hating this and falling. Nobody knows what is going to happen next but tighten your seat belt bois as the ride is going to be bumpy.**

TLDR; Papa pow printed a lot of money and purchased US treasuries. Inflation and higher interest rates by Fed to tame inflation mean treasuries decline in value and traders and institutional investors holding them are selling it. Fed is selling them to reduce their balance sheet and US government is selling them to as part of their debt funding. This is causing the 10 year yields to spike and stocks to go down.

- Post-pandemic we got hit by **Inflation that turned out to be not so transitory** due to Covid supply shocks (including factory closures), Russia invading Ukraine, Above mentioned money printing that was given as aid to US citizens and a host of other factors.

- **Fed has only one tool in its toolbox to tame Inflation.. Higher interest rates.** It hiked from near 0% to 5% in a matter of 18 months. Practically unheard of in modern history. The previous hike in rates like this was done by Fed chair Paul Volcker.. the guy with the balls so strong and heavey, he had to weigh them using a truck scale. Seriously, search him on Google.

- Higher rates mean the previous bonds sold with lower interest rate lose value. If US treasury sells a bond that pays 1% interest for 10 years with $100 face value, and then due to higher interest rate US treasury sells you another note that pays 2% interest for 10 years with $100 face value, the previous note that pays lower interest goes down in value due to higher interest rates on the newer treasuries. So the **return a bond gives a.k.a Yield goes higher when the bond prices go down and vice versa.**

- Fed hiking rates and keeping them higher for longer mean **bond traders** are fearing the higher rates for longer and selling off 10 year US treasury securities. **Japanese institutional investors** are selling US treasury securities, **Fed themselves** are selling Treasury securities that they purchased during Covid to reduce size of their balance sheet and **US Government is also selling US Treasury securities** in open market to fund debt.

- **This has caused 10 Year US treasury Yields to spike and hence any debt including Corporate bonds, Mortgages etc. will have to be funded using higher interest rates restricting growth of economy. Corporate Bonds are also having a major selling off due to higher yields. Higher yields also signal higher interest rates which mean Present value of future earnings goes down. Stocks are hating this and falling. Nobody knows what is going to happen next but tighten your seat belt bois as the ride is going to be bumpy.**

TLDR; Papa pow printed a lot of money and purchased US treasuries. Inflation and higher interest rates by Fed to tame inflation mean treasuries decline in value and traders and institutional investors holding them are selling it. Fed is selling them to reduce their balance sheet and US government is selling them to as part of their debt funding. This is causing the 10 year yields to spike and stocks to go down. Strap your seat belt bois, it is gonna be a bumpy ride for next few months."
1696442990.0,Is there a way to know how likely a company is to go bankrupt?,"Hello fellow regards. For the most part I am happy to gamble and day trade. However sometimes I do like to buy and hold for the longer term without any margin. My question is simple. Is there a way to know percent wise what is the likelihood of a company going bankrupt?

In hindsight for instance BBBY or recently smiledirect filed for bankruptcy. However was there a way to more objectively measure those probabilities? I am sure that with rates staying where they are at and smaller companies running out cash, more of them will be at risk. However those who survive the credit crunch will likely go up after. Therefore, my question.

Edit:

For all of those who ask why I would ask this here. It is really because I know there are lots of unregarded undercover. They sound regard and comment regarded, however they actually know something.

1. Parabola broke today. That's a big problem imo. Parabolic advances tend to retrace 70-80% of the advance.

3. We've broken the support level at $46.50.

When the parabola broke today I did buy some puts on amc (at a ridiculous 500% IV) . So I do have a bias here. My target on AMC is $20-$24 area. I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion but thought I would share my position and my reasoning behind it.

Peeps asking for proof of position. Here ya go. Positions opened yesterday when AMC cracked the parabola. Plan is to exit by Wednesday with around a 50% gain if all goes well. Depending on how it plays out I might open a long spot position on AMC at $20 next week. I don't hate AMC or anything just see an opportunity to profit on the way down and just as content to profit on the way back up.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I‚Äôll use it, but didn‚Äôt want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it‚Äôs sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and PSLV**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things

Thank you for helping [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) go viral and make it on Zerohedge (dreams fulfilled).

Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.

I created an official [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Thehappyhawaii1/status/1355663208774836228?s=20). Not sure if I‚Äôll use it, but didn‚Äôt want anyone to impersonate me.

Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.

**It is organized into 2 sections:**

**1. the futures market (for big players)**

**2. alternatives (for smaller players**)

&#x200B;

**1.**

**The futures market:** for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.  **If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.**  I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.

Let me explain:

When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $8.50 a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.  **This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.** If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.

In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.

There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.

As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.

Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.

**2.**

**This is where the rest of us come in...** if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.

**Physical silver:** by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.

**Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):** this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  If you prefer physical but it‚Äôs sold out or selling for ridiculous premiums, just buy the ETFs until the premiums come down and then sell the ETF to purchase more physical. It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.

**Call options on Silver ETFs:** Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.

**Miners:** miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

**if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.**

**If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and PSLV**

Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

I am not saying the populist anger isn‚Äôt justified or that our system is not flawed or that these hedge funds didn‚Äôt fuck up by shorting something with such a large short float. But sometimes it‚Äôs good to stay calm and analyze things rationally and consider the following opinions from someone who was burned by the short selling ban in 2008 and lost my shirt with my puts in 2012 betting on a cascading bank failure in European when Draghi announced LTRO. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the infinite money machine thesis.

The more the price of GME rises, the likelihood that the SEC will institute a short term trading ban on the stock increases. But vegaseller, you say, we will just Hold and when it resumes  our infinite money wormhole will work again, time is on our side, the shorts have massive margins interests which are compounding.

The problem will be when a private deal is negotiated between GME management and a short seller consortium. It is highly likely there are already negotiations underway between some individual short sellers and the company on a private deal to issue new shares at a significant premium, although much lower than the current market price. Management will be happy to double the shares outstanding at anywhere from $20-100 shares/share, a considerably discount to the current share price. Their concerns are retiring their existing debts and generating cash on their balance sheet for a pivot rather than maintaining their current shares price.

And the higher the run-up in GME share price, the greater the incentive for short sellers to form a consortium and reach a private deals with management and the greater incentive for management to close a deal towards a higher price range. Once a deal is largely settled, they will loop the SEC in to institute a temporary trading halt on the stock. 

If this happens, you guys would be left holding the bag and the share price could easily drop to $10-$50.

 Many here will immediately downvote this because they do not want you to consider any potential future other than the rosy, all your dreams will come true picture they've been hyping over the last several days. They want you to hold no matter what happens. That's not because it's in your best interests but because it's in theirs.  They'll tell you to ignore the naysayers. Ignore those trying to keep you from achieving your dreams and that anyone telling you to do anything other than HOLD is a corporate shill working for the hedge funds. Now ask yourself, why? 

What you have to remember is that you are playing against the smartest, most well capitalized and technologically sophisticated people and organizations on the planet.  Yes this is an unprecedented event, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for this to be resolved and avoiding the infinity squeeze that everyone here is praying for.  You're fighting an uphill battle against a relatively small number of organizations that are playing both sides of this trade already. 

**There's still time to limit your downside risk**

Gains and losses don't exist until you exit your position. Until then, all you have is a paper gain or a paper loss.  If you have gains, you should take some money off of the table. If you have losses, ask yourself how you would feel if you woke up tomorrow and that money was gone. If you are truly ok with that, then by all means, ride this roller-coaster to its end, whatever that end may be. If not, however, you should really think twice about whether you are ok with that.  

**THIS ISN'T FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). THIS IS COMMON SENSE**

I'm ok losing the remaining holdings i have in $GME. This is a small amount of my personal portfolio. Many on here may not be in the same position. I've read countless threads and posts of people taking their last dollar, siphoning credit cards for cash advances, taking loans on their homes...it's insane. Yes it's a unique situation, but the professional traders who have done this and do this every day, all day for years and years can act faster than you, have a strategy and have the capital to chip away at this making money regardless of what happens going forward.

But, for every legitimately smart investor/trader/autist on the sub, there's a cohort of people who want nothing more than to separate others from their money and have no qualms about manipulating you and your desire for an easy win. It's human nature and it's been happening for as long as people could understand the concept of easy money.  If you've read the recent reports on Silver, that's an example of a small group of well-coordinated people taking advantage of the situation with newbies and others who may not even be on here. That said, im limiting this to $GME. 

**NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO SELL. THEY'LL ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD**

It's easy to get everyone on board with idea to buy, and when you're being told the price can go to $10,000 (I've actually seen people legitimately saying it could go much higher), the price you buy at doesn't matter. The same cannot be said for the price at which you sell.  Reading the threads, it might feel like everyone is acting in concert, but not everyone on here is honest. Not everyone here is doing what they say they're doing. Not everyone here gives a damn about you, even if they say they do. Don't allow your confirmation bias to convince yourself to do something you know inside is a bad decision. Invest only what you can afford to lose - period. 

**Winning a war against Wall St. sounds great, but you really need to understand what you're up against**

Shares are bought and sold by professionals in fractions of a second. In the time it took you to read this, the price of GME has fluctuated by as much as $60.  Those who want to pull on your emotions are going to do whatever they can to have you focus on the Us against Them argument, but the fact of the matter is Robinhood isn't a very well capitalized organization, which is why they aren't allowing larger share purchases. Other brokers that don't have the volume that RH has had are taking orders without restriction, but that's because they have not yet hit the level of volume where their clearing capabilities and capital requirements will come into play. If everyone from RH suddenly went to WeBull  for example, you'd likely see the same thing happen there once volume in GME spiked.

NEW EDIT: AMC just announced in their 10k to pursue dilutive equity raises ( debt for equity swaps)

Citing: 

Other Creditor Discussions. While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.


EDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:

\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. 

\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts

\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference

\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol 

\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. 

\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax

\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right

From the above picture: 15+15+20+200+50+44.4 = 344.4 . this compares to a starting share count of 103.8m so total shares out is now 448m (and that does not include all the restricted stock options management issued to themselves)

Which I estimate is another 6m.

ÔÉ® Bottom line share count went up by 4.5x

ÔÉ® And this is all float.. no institutional holders.. (Wanda converted there B shares to A shares to sell them)

# 2. Furthermore the company will keep issuing more shares.

They have another 70m left to issue which will likely be issues in the next days to come.

And ‚Ä¶ here it comes:

The company just filed an Annul general meeting to increase the share count by another 500m.

# Operationally it‚Äôs a severely struggling business:

\- The company burned through 125m a month in Q4

\- That burn will step up to 150m per month in H2 as management has stated at yday call.

\- They have 1bn of cash on hand but that will go down fast

\- Debt is now higher then pre corona and there is another 450m of unpaid rent

\- Share count is 4.5 pre covid .. so today‚Äôs share price really means around 48USD compred to pre covid dilution ‚Äì pre covid it was trading at 6-8USD

\- Remember AMC wasn‚Äôt even able to generate any cash pre- covid

\- The stock rally has saved the debt holders because AMC might indeed be able to avoid bankruptcy.. but given the dilution the stock is still effectively worthless

There is not even that much squeeze potential:

# Lets look at the facts:

# 1. Stocks shorted 55.5m ??

That is a whopping ;) 12.3% of float‚Ä¶. And compares to 260m shares traded yday.. so to cover all shorts you need about 20% of the daily volume.

# 2. But what about a gamma squeeze ???

Again lets look at the facts.

The open interest in all calls is 1.27m .. against that we have 0.684m puts.

Lets totally ignore the puts which have a stable effect on the share price.. lets assume those don‚Äôt exist.

1.27m calls are equivalent to still a high number of 127m shares‚Ä¶

Many of these calls are out of the money..

But hey let's assume ALL the calls end up in the money.

That is 127m shares.. add that to the 55m shorted and you end up at 237m .. which is still only 50% of float!!

Also this compares to 1!!!!! Daily volume.. far from critical.

More realistically assuming a 30% delta and 50% put offset its more an extra 17m shares from calls.

This is not going to the moon.. The fundamentals are not there.

The reason why dildos get exited is that they look at outdated statistics about the shares outstanding and think it is sooo highly shorted.. but the fact is it isn‚Äôt.

CEO Aaron sold 7m worth of stock 

NEW EDIT: AMC just announced in their 10k to pursue dilutive equity raises ( debt for equity swaps)

Citing: 

Other Creditor Discussions. While the liquidity we have raised has substantially extended our liquidity runway, the new debt we have issued, together with the higher interest rate payments that will be required in the future but have largely been deferred, will substantially increase our leverage and future cash requirements. These future cash requirements, like our deferred rent obligations, will present a challenge to our long-term viability if our operating income does not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Even then, we believe we will need to engage in discussions with our creditors to substantially reduce our leverage. We expect to continue to explore alternatives that include new-money financing, potentially in connection with converting debt to equity, which would help manage our leverage but would be dilutive to holders of our common stock. We expect we will continue to receive from and discuss proposals with all classes of creditors. These discussions may not result in any agreement on commercially acceptable terms.


EDIT: I feel like I should respond here to some comments below:

\- Everything I said is factual. It's all linked to the official SEC docs of AMC or Bloomberg as a reliable source. 

\- Its a fact that share count increased to 450m. its a fact that roughly 50m shares are shorted.. .its a fact that even if you add in all the call options you barely get to any squeeze .. these are all facts

\- the fact that I have access to a Bloomberg terminal does not make any difference

\- If you really think I want to drive the share price by posting here.. sorry you are bloody stupid then. AMC trades like 2.5bn every day!!.. Mr bag holder dildo with his 50 shares has no influence lol 

\- yes my account is new. I looked at this once my friends asked me whether to invest in AMC or GME. I know AMC very very very well. I never looked at GME. 

\- I find it irresponsible that unsophisticated people with little money gamble away all their savings by being tricked into a Hoax

\- I did this post so ppl can get the facts right

Regardless, I‚Äôve noticed many of the same pro-GME talking points being recycled ‚Äî often by brand new accounts that have a post history of begging for karma and posting exclusively about GME. You can love the stock, that‚Äôs fine, but if you *really* love the stock, it‚Äôs important to know how you‚Äôre being misled and lied to by posts that frequently hit the front page. In this thread, I‚Äôll be addressing [this post ‚Äî 21.1k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79wdx/why_the_gme_moass_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_is/) specifically, and I‚Äôll also be linking to similar shady posts that parrot the same baseless or misleading claims.

**Claim #1: GME is inversely-correlated with the broader market because the squeeze forces institutions to sell long positions to protect against margin calls**

There does seem to be *some* correlation between GME and the broader market, but this doesn‚Äôt imply causation (or shorts getting squeezed). It‚Äôs not uncommon for meme stocks to do well while the rest of the market is selling off. [Exhibit A](https://postimg.cc/PvGJgzYY) ‚Äî [Exhibit B](https://postimg.cc/1VpXsnrT) ‚Äî notice how RIOT‚Äôs peak in 2018 coincides with SPY‚Äôs trough? That‚Äôs correlation, but not causation. Why does this happen? I can‚Äôt say for sure, but my guess is that stocks like this have a lot of volatility, so when funds pull out of the broader market, they place their wealth in these volatile stocks as kind of a ‚Äústore‚Äù of wealth until the sell-off is finished, at which point they cash out and re-enter the market. Just speculating, though.

What I *can* prove, however, is that the claim that the broader market and GME are inversely correlated is **complete bullshit**, and it takes only [the barest, most basic amount of research](https://postimg.cc/jDjfQcXS). Here, I‚Äôve overlayed the S&P 500 with GME. If there were any correlation, you would see GME go down roughly whenever SPY went up, and vice-versa. Not good enough? Think GME ought to be valued as a tech company? [Nasdaq similary shows no correlation](https://postimg.cc/VdgMCpXh). Yes, I know the overlays aren‚Äôt perfect, but I‚Äôm working on an iPad here ‚Äî cut me some slack. Regardless, you can see there is **no correlation**, proving that this part of Bows_N_Hoes post is **bullshit**.

For the record, I *do* think there was an inverse correlation between GME and the broader market back in February. In my opinion, there genuinely was a threat of system collapse. The IBKR chairman himself admitted that. (Request a link to the vid in comments and I‚Äôll provide. I can‚Äôt post it in OP or my post will get whacked). In this case, hedge funds likely *did* have to sell some of their positions to free up liquidity so that they could cover or protect their shorts. This led to the broader market falling while GME squoze. As demonstrated, this correlation no longer exists.

Note: This claim is about inverse correlation is the same as [another unfounded claim ‚Äî 4.4k upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6if56/the_mythical_unicorn_aka_extremely_abnormal/) that hit the front page of WSB, and which one of WSB‚Äôs mods similarly dismantled.

**Claim 2: The illegal practice of naked short selling is causing the stock to show over 140% ownership**

The post claims that short shares are being invented out of thin air and sold on the market. While this is theoretically possible (but illegal!), this is pure speculation. So how then, might you ask, can a stock display over 100% ownership? When stocks are shorted, they are *borrowed* from someone who owns the stock, and then sold. Now, the same shares can be lent from one person to another to another. All of the entities borrowind the stock must report ownership of the stock. So, imagine it this way: I lend my dildo to my friend, and then *he* lends that dildo to *his* friend. I would report owning that dildo, my friend would report owning that dildo (albeit temporarily) and *his* friend would report owning that dildo. So you see how one single dildo can become three? [Investopedia even has an article about this](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp ). The same thing is happening to GME, and any claims that higher than 100% institutional ownership being indicative of the illegal practice of short selling is pure speculation, of which no one has yet provided proof.

**Claim #3: No seriously, these ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù are real, and are being sold back and forth on the market place!**

Do you know what you get when you Google ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù? A bunch of [Indian biomed companies](https://postimg.cc/FYc2syMD) with ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù in their company name. Do you know what happens when you control for these Indian biomed companies?  You get results that are [basically nothing](https://postimg.cc/xcBw2x4X). If ‚Äúsynthetic shares‚Äù were a real phenomenon, you wouldn‚Äôt have to go digging through this many foreign small-cap biomed companies to find any information about it. And before anyone chimes in, snthetic call options and put options *are* real, but those are **very** different from what OP is claiming.

**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME‚Äôs rise!**

People who make this claim often resort to proving it by:

* using complex calculations

* depend on incomplete data

* make suppositions

* discard any data that disproves their claims

[Source ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)

However, we don‚Äôt need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn‚Äôt have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.

Here, we have a few important metrics:

*Short interest ‚Äî 16% ‚Äî the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float ‚Äî while 16% is atypically high, it‚Äôs nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.

* Borrow rate ‚Äî 0.6% ‚Äî particularly low. Borrow rates ‚Äî that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis ‚Äî go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.

* Borrow availability ‚Äî 300,000 shares ‚Äî the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as ‚Äúno shares available for shorting‚Äù for a long time ‚Äî *days, even* ‚Äî since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.

So there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam‚Äôs Razor, y‚Äôall](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

**Conclusion**

Now you have to ask yourself ‚Äî do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it‚Äôs the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it‚Äôs the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don‚Äôt lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers.

**Claim #4: Hedge funds are totally getting squeezed by GME‚Äôs rise!**

People who make this claim often resort to proving it by:

* using complex calculations

* depend on incomplete data

* make suppositions

* discard any data that disproves their claims

[Source ‚Äî 600 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/)

However, we don‚Äôt need to do any logical loop-de-loops to prove that GMe doesn‚Äôt have an exceptionally high level of short interest. In fact, all we have to do is go to [an old fan favorite of WSB](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) to see the true story laid out for us in a very clear, concise argument.

Here, we have a few important metrics:

*Short interest ‚Äî 16% ‚Äî the amount of shares short as a percentage of the float ‚Äî while 16% is atypically high, it‚Äôs nowhere *near* the purported 100-350% [some suspicious people](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6ya2t/the_easiest_way_to_calculate_gme_short_interest/) with one-month old accounts are shilling.

* Borrow rate ‚Äî 0.6% ‚Äî particularly low. Borrow rates ‚Äî that is, the rate people are paid to lend out the stock on a yearly basis ‚Äî go up a lot the more a stock is shorted. For reference, RKT was at 20% a few weeks ago.

* Borrow availability ‚Äî 300,000 shares ‚Äî the most heavily shorted stocks often appear as ‚Äúno shares available for shorting‚Äù for a long time ‚Äî *days, even* ‚Äî since their shares are so in demand to borrow and sell short.

So there you have it. Three very simple, easy metrics you can use to verify that the stock is not as heavily shorted as some people want you to believe. To believe otherwise would mean you would have to buy in to conspiracies about a wide-ranging collaboration between various market participants and entities with differing aims, ethics, and stakes, involving thousands of people, and all to cover up the true short rate of just *one* stock. [Occam‚Äôs Razor, y‚Äôall](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).

**Conclusion**

Now you have to ask yourself ‚Äî do you like the *stock* or do you like the *hype*? Because if it‚Äôs the former, then you should not be supporting the people continually spreading disinformation about it. If it‚Äôs the latter, then have fun on this wild ride, but don‚Äôt lie or support lying to your fellow WSBers. It‚Äôs immoral,  and it;s not cute when somekne points out these lies and incosistencies and all you can say is ‚Äútl;dr, buying more‚Äù."

(A Timeline of Biden's Actions on Oil And Gas)

**January 20, 2021** : Biden‚Äôs first actions was to¬†revoke approval for the Keystone XL, and impose a moratorium on oil and gas leasing federal lands and waters . Roughly 25% of U.S. production comes from federal areas.

Regulation & you've just eliminated 25% of the U.S supply. Does anyone know how supply and demand works? Did he stop there? Of course not!

**February 26, 2021:** Biden updates the ""social cost of greenhouse gas emissions,"" dramatically altering the way the U.S. government calculates the real-world costs of climate change. The administration plans boost the figure it will use to assess greenhouse gas pollution's damage inflicts on society to $51 per ton of carbon dioxide (**Seven times higher**) . This would apply to any new oil and gas lease sale, raising producers‚Äô costs to deliver new supplies.

Another Tax expense on something that can't even be measured  
accurately, $51 per ton (7X Higher) who pays for it? You! Cost push, you thin I'm done? I've only started.

**June 1, 2021:** Eliminating a slew of tax benefits for oil, gas and coal producers. Eliminating these tax provisions imperils U.S. energy security by raising costs for domestic producers and would increase America‚Äôs reliance on foreign energy supplies.

Ohh so you removed tax benefits issued by the previous administration, sounds like an added cost. Who pays? You!

**August 11, 2021:**¬†Biden calls on OPEC+ producers to increase supply to help curb rising oil prices, even though the U.S. is one of the three largest producers in the world and can deliver supply with a lower carbon footprint

We're the top producer of oil in the entire world, yet we've become dependent on countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia . Not only can we supply ourselves with oil but we could do it with less carbon foot print then the rest of the world.

( The Biden administration has set new requirements that increase the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation‚Äôs gasoline supply.)

If all this wasn't bad enough now we have people who produce nothing (Politicians) telling the private sector how to produce oil. They want to increase the use of ethanol in gas.

I'll make the argument on why ethanol is a horrible idea in bullet points.

* 95% of ethanol is produced from corn , we have a major corn shortage. This will worsen the already bad food supply.
* Expect increase use in fertilizer also experiencing a major shortage .
* Ethanol can be extremely damaging to engines and high-powered sports equipment, leading to corrosion of the engine and fuel system.

So. I've been daytrading since around June of last year. As you can see from my all-time chart, it was a rough journey. I started in 2017 and found wallstreet bets, I was originally trading JNUG and shit like that, which was pretty popular on the sub back in the day. I evolved my strategy to basically ""buy calls on big tech"" and yeah...it worked out. I actually cashed out on a downswing because Merril Lynch gave you access to a higher quality trading platform and information if your account size was over 75k or something like that, so at the end of the day on that original push I ended up making enough to buy my house for cash, around 180k. Think it was facebook calls?

After that, I thought of myself as hot shit and every year around my birthday, I would use the distribution from my family's company as fuel for a robinhood degen spree. Ended up blowing up like 4 accounts? Maybe 60-70k total. Pretty gross stuff.

But then, around 2020 DEC I inherited a fat chunk of money because we sold our family business. Was like 3.4m after taxes. I put a few mil into robinhood and just let it ride. If you check the charts, that was literally RIGHT BEFORE the covid fuckery. I invested at the absolute PEAK of the market. Kinda poor timing with regards to inheriting money and trying to be responsible, but no complaints obviously, free money is free.

After that, I tolerated the pain and was just watching the market. Around my birthday again in June, after getting my asshole reamed for like 6 months I said FUCK IT I can do better than just letting this shit do what it wants to do. I started trading.

Originally, it was mostly theta gang. As you can see, that was relatively successful. That ended when the market climbed over 400. I started daytrading, probably by feb/march of 2023?

Anyway, I've had about two YOLOS where I was 7 figures invested in options a few months out. That first fuckery, I ended up profiting about 85k which was insane. The stress was unreal and I was down A LOT at one point in time. The second yolo was more recently, the charts don't do it justice but I was down about 200k+ at one point in time as well. Ended up selling that second one for a 20k loss.

After that second YOLO you can see I became more disciplined again, its like a 40 degree angle straight up with very little deviation. It was a kick in the ass/wake-up call for sure.

Anyway...my strategy is based both on TA: resistances/support, and being somewhat cautious when getting into a position. I generally will only buy like 20% of what I'm willing to risk at any given time, and if it moves against me I will average into the position. I will sell for about .10 a contract.

I just daytrade, the times when I'm holding overnight are usually because mistakes were made and I misjudged a resistance/support but had enough conviction not to cut my losses.

Usually I will buy another 20% when my original position is down like .10, and continue to average down as it moves in a meaningful direction against my position. Sometimes I will sell for a breakeven or a bit more than .10 profit.

Honestly? A lot of what I do is based on TA that is informed by gut feelings. I've literally spent thousands of hours watching the market over the last 6-7 years even when not trading it. I couldn't accurately explain why I do what I do and its probably impossible to replicate.

But overall? I'd say there are a few over-arching rules that will make you more money in the long run.

&#x200B;

One: Don't go balls deep into a position regardless of how convinced you are of it. Decide what you're willing to risk and only go like 20% max at first to leave yourself room to average down if it moves against you. This will make it so if even you're wrong about the exact pricing, if you're correct about the general movement of the stock you can still make profit.

Two: Be patient. If you've identified what a good entry point for your position is, then stick to that. Stick to your guns. Theres been plenty of times where I missed an entry because it didn't quite hit my price target, you just shrug it off and move on with your life. There will be more opportunities later in the day, or opportunities in other stocks, so don't beat yourself up over it.

Three: Take profits. Just do it. Before you enter a trade, you should have an entry point and an exit point identified and if you sell at your exit point for profit, then good job. Just take profits.

Four: Don't have any regrets. Analyze your decision making process, and if it was based on rationality as opposed to emotion then don't regret your choices. Every trade is a new thing. Even if you end up buying back in at a lower price than you sold your previous position at, if its based on rational choices then don't regret it. Take your profits as they come.

Five: Self Analysis. Dig into why you made the choices that you made. If its emotionally based, then learn to recognize those emotions and what causes them and counterbalance that shit. Otherwise...yeah...always analyze your trades.

So. I've been daytrading since around June of last year. As you can see from my all-time chart, it was a rough journey. I started in 2017 and found wallstreet bets, I was originally trading JNUG and shit like that, which was pretty popular on the sub back in the day. I evolved my strategy to basically ""buy calls on big tech"" and yeah...it worked out. I actually cashed out on a downswing because Merril Lynch gave you access to a higher quality trading platform and information if your account size was over 75k or something like that, so at the end of the day on that original push I ended up making enough to buy my house for cash, around 180k. Think it was facebook calls?

After that, I thought of myself as hot shit and every year around my birthday, I would use the distribution from my family's company as fuel for a robinhood degen spree. Ended up blowing up like 4 accounts? Maybe 60-70k total. Pretty gross stuff.

But then, around 2020 DEC I inherited a fat chunk of money because we sold our family business. Was like 3.4m after taxes. I put a few mil into robinhood and just let it ride. If you check the charts, that was literally RIGHT BEFORE the covid fuckery. I invested at the absolute PEAK of the market. Kinda poor timing with regards to inheriting money and trying to be responsible, but no complaints obviously, free money is free.

After that, I tolerated the pain and was just watching the market. Around my birthday again in June, after getting my asshole reamed for like 6 months I said FUCK IT I can do better than just letting this shit do what it wants to do. I started trading.

Originally, it was mostly theta gang. As you can see, that was relatively successful. That ended when the market climbed over 400. I started daytrading, probably by feb/march of 2023?

Anyway, I've had about two YOLOS where I was 7 figures invested in options a few months out. That first fuckery, I ended up profiting about 85k which was insane. The stress was unreal and I was down A LOT at one point in time. The second yolo was more recently, the charts don't do it justice but I was down about 200k+ at one point in time as well. Ended up selling that second one for a 20k loss.

After that second YOLO you can see I became more disciplined again, its like a 40 degree angle straight up with very little deviation. It was a kick in the ass/wake-up call for sure.

Anyway...my strategy is based both on TA: resistances/support, and being somewhat cautious when getting into a position. I generally will only buy like 20% of what I'm willing to risk at any given time, and if it moves against me I will average into the position. I will sell for about .10 a contract.

I just daytrade, the times when I'm holding overnight are usually because mistakes were made and I misjudged a resistance/support but had enough conviction not to cut my losses.

Usually I will buy another 20% when my original position is down like .10, and continue to average down as it moves in a meaningful direction against my position. Sometimes I will sell for a breakeven or a bit more than .10 profit.

Honestly? A lot of what I do is based on TA that is informed by gut feelings. I've literally spent thousands of hours watching the market over the last 6-7 years even when not trading it. I couldn't accurately explain why I do what I do and its probably impossible to replicate.

But overall? I'd say there are a few over-arching rules that will make you more money in the long run.

&#x200B;

One: Don't go balls deep into a position regardless of how convinced you are of it. Decide what you're willing to risk and only go like 20% max at first to leave yourself room to average down if it moves against you. This will make it so if even you're wrong about the exact pricing, if you're correct about the general movement of the stock you can still make profit.

Two: Be patient. If you've identified what a good entry point for your position is, then stick to that. Stick to your guns. Theres been plenty of times where I missed an entry because it didn't quite hit my price target, you just shrug it off and move on with your life. There will be more opportunities later in the day, or opportunities in other stocks, so don't beat yourself up over it.

Three: Take profits. Just do it. Before you enter a trade, you should have an entry point and an exit point identified and if you sell at your exit point for profit, then good job. Just take profits.

Four: Don't have any regrets. Analyze your decision making process, and if it was based on rationality as opposed to emotion then don't regret your choices. Every trade is a new thing. Even if you end up buying back in at a lower price than you sold your previous position at, if its based on rational choices then don't regret it. Take your profits as they come.

Five: Self Analysis. Dig into why you made the choices that you made. If its emotionally based, then learn to recognize those emotions and what causes them and counterbalance that shit. Otherwise...yeah...always analyze your trades.

&#x200B;

1652668081.0,Avoid any stock with China influence or roots. Also prepare for a bear market for a while.,"Sup boys, been taking a break waiting on the crash since Trump miracled 7 trillion into the market.

I thought when Biden got in it would collapse but it looks like it took 2 years.

I dont think we're done though.  Heres why.

China imminent collapse.

War in Russia.  Nato escalations. 

World wide shortages. 

 Cryptocurreny collapse.

Let me start with üá®üá≥ 

Chinas economy has run rampant for the last 20 years.  The United States borrows trillions from China.  However, China is in a deeper bubble than we have ever seen.  

Chinas main source of economy is in real estate.   Do you know there are abaondoned sky scrapers in China right now?  Its like detroit had a baby with dubai.  They built a city for 10 million people and cant even get 100,000 to buy the properties. The banks print out real estate loans more than Jpow is printing out singles.

This happened in dubai as well, I'm not sure on current affairs but i remember all the sports cars like Ferrari and Mclarens left abandoned in parking lots and the desert after they defaulted and left country before they got their heads chopped off. (Serious arab law)

Today you can explore abandoned high rises in china, some half constructed abandoned.

In 2021 Q4 484 chinese businesses defaulted on their major real estate payments. (This should be double digits)

On top of all of this, covid has run absolutely rampant to the point they are locking people in üçé factories and can't leave.  This may be what pops the bubble but I would not put a nickel of my burger king check into any China owned companies. Have you all tried to buy a car lately?  You cant.  China and all of the nafta companies aren't producing near enough goods.  If you can't sell you cant make tendies.

If and when the bubble burst it will shake up an already rattled global economy with the üá∫üá¶ war.   I think this year possibly next the united states will enter into the war. 

Already ships like the USS Kearsarge are in route to the Baltic Sea arrived 24hours ago

I would guess a 5-10 trillion dollar loss on NASDAQ overnight is possible could be this year if announce of the war, I'm sure it will start with a russian attack that hits american troops, a plane or an embassy.  The moment this happens (it will) you need to start shorting before the boomers pull out of their 401k.  

If you already havent pulled out of your 401k consider it, transfer it to a roth ira or something like S&P500 on td ameriteade thats setup for retirement where you can pull out quickly. 

On top of that the ticking time bomb of China we got a goold old great depression cooking.

Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.

**Current Share Price:** 10.12

**Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:** \-0.89 (0.1 Q3 2020)

**Annual Sales:** 28.9B

**Annual Dividend per Share:** 0.10

**Historical Price/Earnings (Median):** 16.70

**Book Value Per Share:** 0.2939

([https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-companys-stock-price-21802.html))

I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula

1a. SQR ((15)(1.5)(.1)(0.2939)) = 0.81 (actual value per share)

2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)

2a. ((16.70)(0.1)) = 1.67 (intrinsic value)

&#x200B;

This means the actual *value* of the stock is *Drumroll Please...*

Between  $0.81 - $1.67

&#x200B;

If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.

1612084069.0,Citadel bought GME?!?!,"So as everyone knows, the Hedge Fund with the biggest short position on GME is Melvin Capital.  As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts. 

On a post the other day someone sent the following helpful [link with positions hedge funds have](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME).  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With 111.8k shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.

Does anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?

TLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don‚Äôt want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.

So bassically we have a batman pattern in 2008 and were curently on the right ear of a batman patern right now. Whats interesting is the VW infinity squeeze happened in October 08, just to the right of batmans ear. We are currently in the middle of a GME infinity squeeze, and are currently, on batmans right ear. The difference is what side of batman the crashes are, in 2008 the crash is to the right of batman, in 2020 the crash is to the left of batman. So that kills the pattern right? Wrong, in 2008 The fed didnt start the quantiative easing until 3 months after lehman brothers went bankrupt and the worst that could happen, happenned. In 2020 the fed Started QE as soon as possible, thus the reversed sides of batman make complete sense.

With all this said, this could mean that SLV will finish it's batman ear and the gme squeeze will crash SLV and then a recovery to ATH, it could mean that because of the reversed crash patterns SLV will start climbing to ATH without finishing batmans ear, or, the most likely scenario, this means absolutely nothing and I just wasted a couple hours of my weekend.

EDIT: I think I should clear this up, I'm not advocating to dump gme and buy slv. SLV wont start rising to ATH until after the GME infinity squeeze. We need it to happen

**The AMC dividend gives AMC the ability to dilute up to 450 % after ex-div date of APE token without seeking any shareholder approval.** 

**Ape token has same voting rights as AMC common stock on allowing conversion from APE to AMC -> you own majority of shares in AMC+APE through either ticker you control AMC.**

**Stock is not down 80 % yet so this shit is gonna come down hard soon (I give it a month max NFA). Easy short, puts into and after ex dividend date = free money (???). Bulls r insanely fk.**

As most of us know AMC had earnings on thursday after hours. It was a sought after earnings as AA had been hinting to something big happening, a ‚Äúpounce‚Äù some might say. What this proved to be was a Preferred stock dividend with the ticker $APE (lol). Most people were let down by this, some were excited, but if you look under the hood it is insane how the AMC stock price as of today ended the day up over 18 % and you might think how the fuck did that happen?

Last year AMC sought shareholder approval for an issuance of an additional 25 million shares to raise cash, but shareholders dissapproved of this as the apes had gotten tired of getting diluted. With AMCs current cash burn rate and their deferred rent payments at the time they did not have a lot of runway left before an inevitable bankruptcy unless they drastically improved their business. The most recent quarter AMC posted a loss to the tune of 121.6 million $, no share dilution approved still, but in comes AA with ‚Äúthe pounce‚Äù.

What this pounce actually turned out to be was a big middle finger to all the investors who disapproved of their requested 25 million share dilution last year. He did not only find a way to get this dilution without shareholder approval. He did not double down, not quadruple down but 100x double down by issuing a new stock which have the exact same voting rights as AMC common stock on the conversion from APE to AMC (lol).

This new ticker which we all know as $APE will give AA and the C-suite the ability to dilute it up to 4.5 billion shares after it has started trading on the NYSE. AA says black on white this was his plan B if investors didnt approve of a dilution (He always finds a way to dilute ;) )

He is also no stranger to dilution. Through the late parts of 2021 and first half of 2021 he diluted like his life depended on it as we see in the image below.

Some might say ‚Äúbut the APE dilution doesn‚Äôt matter as AMC wont be diluted so my shares should retain their value‚Äù. This is wrong because the $APE shares have literally all the properties AMC have when it comes to the vote for conversion. The ""vote for conversion"" if passed would make it so that one share of APE will be convertable into 1 common share of AMC. And if that vote passes 1 share of ape is identical to 1 share of AMC. You control majority vote through either APE or AMC you control the company. Its literally the same stock, but a different ticker.

 So both preferred stock units and common shares get the same voting power and can vote on the common stock amendment. AA can dilute the preferred stock by up to 4.5 billion shares. Assuming retail owns the entire float of AMC (this is not true) that means they will have to buy up after full dilution a minimum of 1.739 billion APE tokens from all dilutions to exclude any chance of being outvoted by any others on the conversion vote from $APE to $AMC common stock. Retail simply does not have that capital, and to be frank they do not own the float on AMC. Last shareholders meeting had a total of 268,775,910 voters as can be seen in the relevant SEC filing.

1614485733.0,How you're ACTUALLY getting fucked,"Judging from the average post and comment on here, most of you correctly suspect that the financial service industry and financial regulations have generally fucked you over, but you then seem to think that every possible way you might get fucked, no matter how far fetched, is actually true.

I'm here to tell you that a broker doesn't try to trade against you when you execute a trade, the Fed doesn't directly lend money to hedge funds to short, short ladder attacks don't exist, that naked shorting is not happening, and hedge funds generally underperform the market so they're just as stupid as anyone else.

1. Brokers find counterparties to trade with through market makers. They do not want to take the risk of being a counterparty to your trade, because they have no idea whether you are informed are not. They earn money through fees and in the case of RH, by selling order flow and by having poorer execution than most brokers.
2. The Fed lends money to banks through the discount window. Yes, it is true that the most recent quantitative easing has benefited asset prices but not the economy, so it's been a bust from a social welfare standpoint and has basically been a net transfer of wealth from people who are newly saving to the already wealthy. (The first QE in 2008 and 2009 may have been necessary, but that's a more complex story.)
3. Short ladder attacks just don't exist. I don't know what else to say about this one.
4. Shorting goes above 100% of shares outstanding in the following way: a share is lent to be shorted and sold short and the investor who buys that shorted share lends it out again to be shorted. In theory this could go on arbitrarily high. It's fine to want a regulation that limits the amount of shorting as a percentage of shares outstanding. I think this is sensible and would mitigate volatility but there's no naked shorting going on.
5. [Hedge funds have been underperforming](https://www.evidenceinvestor.com/study-sheds-light-on-why-hedge-funds-are-struggling/) by 0.8% per annum on a risk-adjusted basis since 2009.

How are you actually being screwed?

1. While there is not direct regulatory capture of the Federal Reserve, numerous economists that work for the Reserve have thoughts of potentially getting high paying Wall Street jobs. They almost never want to write a paper that just shits all over banks. This and the fact that they speak to banks but do not speak to us directly means that their policies lean towards helping banks. This is isn't some weird backroom moustache twirling bullshit that seems to be pushed around. Unfortunately, it's a bit worse, since it's an endemic cultural problem with incentives that are hard to untangle.
2. High frequency trading firms / market makers like Citadel, Jane Street, and Renaissance Medallion Fund earn their alpha in the most volatile periods for two reasons: they earn wide bid-ask spreads and the market is highly predictable on a short term basis during those periods, so they're effectively front-running the herd that is leaving or entering a position.
3. Less of a problem in WSB, but mutual fund companies launch tons of funds and only market the ones that do well obviously. They rely on survivorship bias and luck to drive assets. They make different bets in different funds and they'll certainly have a winner somewhere.
4. Brokers try to convince you that you can beat the market. The average retail investor does not beat the market. They are the counterparty to the institutional investor who does beat the market.

How do you avoid being screwed? However boring it is, if you buy and hold a global stock ETF, no one can ever fuck with you. It barely trades.

Everyone SEEMS to be super self-aware of their own intellectual shortcomings (let's call it) but ironically, people then state utter nonsense with supreme confidence and everyone pats them on the back for being correct and ""in the know."" (""This guy still thinks that there are two political parties in the United States. Don't you know the parties are owned by the same corporate interests?"" Wow. So insightful and edgy, even though the two parties agree on almost nothing.) It's not that hard to nab a job of some sort at a large asset manager, and the pay isn't bad either. See how it actually is. It's far more mundane and when there's evil, it's banal evil--shutting down the underperforming fund and only mentioning the outperforming ones to prospective clients or trying to explain away bad performance in overly technical terms hoping that your clients think you're smart and don't fire you.

The industry needs to change desperately. It sucks away talent to do useless bullshit. It often acts as a net transfer of wealth from investor to asset manager. But it's not what you guys think it is at all.

Remember that energy deflation was the number one driver of overall disinflation? Remember how there wasn‚Äôt any rumor for OPEC cut? It surprised everyone and oil was bought immediately. Remember how energy prices underpin all economic activity - and that Biden already blew the SPR?

Remember how the bulls just put together an epic 2 quarter rally from October to today, with rising rates, collapsing banks, and a shit economic outlook? Remember how they bought the dip, deployed their bonuses, deployed their tax returns and are all sitting on unrealized gains?

Remember now that capital was deployed, and is still deployed, on the rumor of a fed pivot and a soft landing? On the rumor of ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different‚Äù? Remember how people are using 0DTE or margin to go all in on FRC shares?

Remember how retail always moves last and the wealth transfer only works when retail deployed leveraged capital at the top - only to be liquidated on the way down - so smart money can deploy leverage capital at the bottom. 

Remember that Powell has delivered on his dot plot, and on expectations, at every meeting. Remember that ‚Äúno one sees rate cuts for the rest of the year‚Äù is what the man said.

Remember money supply is tightening and banks are essentially all zombies at this point. All of them owe their existence to the feds special facility - they do what the fed wants - the fed wants inflation down unemployment up.

Remember that unemployment might be hard to move, a lot of dead old people, no real immigration, no cheap labor. Remember pow doesn‚Äôt control unemployment, just the cost of money - so how much HIGHER does the dial need to go until we see 4 percent unemployment?

Remember the money supply has never slowed this fast, to this degree, and remember US runs on credit. No credit? No growth, no more EPS no more multiple expansion.

Remember, policy acts with a lag - nothing has happened yet in the real economy besides some minimal layoffs, SPACs died, and SVB died. A blip on the radar - the impact has been meaningless thus far.

Remember, the smartest of retail will take their gains. Bearish. The dumbest of retail will buy the dip again, with leverage, just loading up positions on the wrong side of the boat. This makes the liquidation on the way down even more violent. Bearish.

1615962803.0,Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term,"First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Not financial advice, just my 2 cents on these two hot tickers. I'm holding RKT shares and leaps, invested before the spike, sold some profit and hold the rest for medium to long term.",wallstreetbets,"Why UWMC is no match for RKT in the long term First, I'm not talking about any squeeze potential, which can happen to either/both stocks. I'm interested in the business models of these companies.

**Intro**

I think many people are familiar with the RKT/UWMC feud after the RKT squeeze put both in the spot light. UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers to stop working with other companies, which supposedly 90% of their existing broker partners agreed to. Many people here and on other subreddits are invested, and claiming each of these companies are significantly undervalued. I just want to put things into perspective from the business model side and future outlook side. 

**Business Model - direct lending and broker lending**

First, let's talk about their business models. RKT is fairly diversified a number of lending businesses, with their TPO division for brokers but majority of their mortgage lending business direct to consumer. On the other hand, UWMC only deal with mortgage brokers, who make their cut between the lender and consumer. 

In general, consumers with good credit and who has long standing existing banking relations with a bank or credit union will go there first. They may compare a few lenders to get the best rate, but generally working with lenders directly, especially if they know someone in the business. Only when you have a special circumstance on your credit history/rating or when you can't get a satisfactory loan directly from your local lenders, then your realtor may suggest going to a broker. Brokers make money because they may be able to get you a loan that otherwise you may not (or shouldn't) qualify for. This actually contributed a lot to the mortgage default crisis in 08. 

When I bought my first house I had a special circumstance for my loan application and couldn't get the loan size that I wanted with lenders, and my realtor suggested we can go find brokers who can find high interest rate loans of that size, some of them even from private lenders. Luckily we were able to find a credit union that could work with us. But you get the gist - mortgage brokers sometimes work with (and sometimes prey on) people with low credit who can't loans directly from lenders, and this is what they get paid for. Not all brokers are bad, but there is definitely a ""car salesman"" feeling from them. In the end, I would think the loans that brokers push through are in general more risky than direct to consumer loans. I don't work in the business but people who do could find some statistics. When rates starts to rise, and also after the mortgage moratorium end, the first to default will be these higher interest rate loans from brokers. I think RKT is positioned better than UWMC in a higher interest rate environment.

**Innovation and growth**

This will go hand in hand with the valuation section below. Brokers, no matter what they are brokering, are a thing of the past. With information and technology, the trend is definitely for individuals to browse and pick on their own. This is not to say everything should be automated. Especially for a big purchase like a house, professional help is needed and this is why realtors still have a job even with the rise of Zillow and Redfin etc. But professional help is really only need for getting legal things done and for things that requires tacit skills like negotiating prices on an offer. Mortgage requirements are for the most part set in stone and rates are mostly non-negotiable. So what is the job of the broker? They just aggregate information for you, which technology is poised to do just as well, if not better. Technology also brings transparency so everyone's competing on a level field; you don't need to ""know a guy"" to get your loan at the best rates for your situation. This kind of no frills experience is the new way of doing business and led to the rise of Zillow, Carmax, lemonade, etc. RKT is trying to do that and this is what will transform the mortgage industry, not someone like UWMC, who is just trying to squeeze both the brokers and consumers to get more profits in the short term and stay alive.

**valuation** 

A lot of people are talking of each companies valuations relative to many metrics like sales and earnings. You cannot compare these ratios to the tech and meme growth stocks that we are all so familiar with. Just go to finviz and put in P/S under 4 and see how many companies show up. If a company doesn't have high margins and/or potential for exponential growth, they will not and should not carry a huge P/S ratio. For UWMC, I don't see any way this company can grow very fast or innovate, especially given their hostile attitude towards their own broker partners. For RKT it's harder to say whether their technologies like the mostly automatic underwriting process, and also their attempt to have good UI and customer service, is enough to be deserving of a high valuation. But at least I do see them transforming the traditional mortgage business and I think they stand a high chance of maintaining their rapid growth as more tech-savvy people start to purchase homes.

**Summary**

Don't just buy into UWMC because they spiked later than RKT and they ""seem like an undervalued"" stock. A quick look at the different approaches of these two companies clearly reveals who is the innovative ""sleeping giant"" and who is the boomer stock. While both may be good speculative short term plays, if you are serious long term investor I would take a long and hard at these companies.

Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. 


With lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more. Now add a slowdown in economy to the mix where they will have lower demand, Tesla has probably just posted their best earnings for the next 4-6 quarters. 


This is probably peak Tesla in this cycle. Now let's look at their cashflows. Tesla claims to have enough cash to get through the hard times. This quarter alone, they have used up 15% of their cash from end of Q3. 


Tesla also has an increase in inventory which is not huge but not a great sign. If everything is going so great, we need to see the opposite. 


TL:DR This is a warning post for those of you who think Tesla has dropped ""enough."" When you compare it with other auto manufacturers you see the disconnect.

1612196813.0,I think that the Silver hate is actually what they are looking for. Here me out before you nuke me.,"Preface: BUY GME DONT SELL HOLD AND FUCK CITADEL.

I am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks. The criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct. There are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up.   


I hope you all realize that the Hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of GME. They understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is: people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it. 

Paper silver shares are not the move, obviously, but Silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly. EMPHASIS ON NEXT\* DO NOT SELL GME OR MOVE INTO THIS POSITION UNTIL THIS WAR IS OVER.

If people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares, it will result in devastation for the Hedgies and Big Banks. This is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get WSBs to call off the dogs on silver all together. Don't underestimate your enemy, they understand what reactions their actions will get.   


Silver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble, but it needs to be done in a specific way. If the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists, then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material. If the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens, they are fucked,   


This is still the long play imo, but I have been in this space for many many years. It is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes. It could be the best next move in this war, but we will see. I am long silver, but I am a physical collector. I think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after.   


My suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now, but don't forget about it when the GME stage finally resolves. That is what they want. Let's win this GME short squeeze before we promote any other moves, but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies. They are learning what their actions result in, and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they don't want you focusing on.

1643128388.0,Apes ruined WSB as we know it,"Oh boy, here it goes

GME squeeze in its early stages was a fantastic event, plenty of people that were already on WSB entered positions at 5-10-20-40 dollars and rode to the top, exiting and realizing gains. It was a great event that became pretty popular, and unfortunately attracted 8 million other user, who knew fuck all about investing and just wanted to make a quick buck by sticking it to the hedgies. Problem with them was that they came in and acted like they were the next Warren Buffet, and anyone who disagreed with them was a dumb shill or didn‚Äôt understand the movement‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

Stock kept dropping further, going all the way down to $40 dollars, before other 8 million users realized that they were too late for an initial squeeze, and decided that the MOASS is yet to come.

What was initially a calculated plan in a company that was trading as it was already bankrupt became a platform of firing the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù and sticking it to the ‚Äúhedgies‚Äù

Conspiracy theories started spreading, goalposts were being moved, and anyone that disagreed was downvotes into oblivion. There were days when every single post on WSB was about GME. 

That‚Äôs fine, no harm in that, if it wasn‚Äôt for the mob mentality of literally calling anyone a shill. I was trying to make posts urging new traders to take profits, that trading is a 1 vs 1, not a team game, but my posts were either deleted or I was heavily downvoted.

I started learning about trading on WSB, browsing the sub in 2017. Back then I knew absolutely nothing about options, or trading. This sub was actually a great resource for learning from extremely smart people.
I know there is a stigma that everyone on WSB is retarded, however, back then it was actually smart people with six or seven digit portfolios just goofing around and making risky but **calculated** bets. 
Nowadays, it‚Äôs really just a competition in who is dumber and who can write the shittiest DD, than say not a financial advice at the end, and if someone challenges them, they‚Äôll just say ‚Äú sir this is Wendy‚Äôs‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a retard‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI eat crayons‚Äù. 

Thankfully over the past few months the amount of kids who thought they were some trading gurus for buying a tech stock in March 2020 decreased dramatically, apes moved to another sub that is now ripe with conspiracy theories and constant moving of goalposts. 

I just want to highlight one thing, people are tired of apes flooding this sub, this sub was never meant to be a GME circle jerk. But don‚Äôt take it from me, take it from ZJZ, a mod who has been with WSB for many years and kept it a sane place. Even he is tired of apes coming here and shilling a brick and mortar store that continues bleeding cash. 

https://i.imgur.com/oWnUhfT.jpg 

I want to be clear, not a single DD written by apes in the past 6 months has been correct, not one has materialized, and not one date they called led to MOASS. Frankly this sub needs more discussion and DD. You might say, dope, so write DD, be the change you want to see, and trust me I do to.

However, many times DD gets downvotes or you get called for being a shill for a stock that has any sort of cult following, be it WISH, AMC, GME, or any other popular stock.",wallstreetbets,"Apes ruined WSB as we know it Oh boy, here it goes

1655501701.0,The Fed is making a big mistake,"The Fed just raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the largest single rate hike since 1994. It's another step in the Fed's efforts to tackle the fastest inflation in 40 years.

&#x200B;

I understand the urgency of the Fed, but it has entered dangerous territory. If the Fed continues down this path - as it suggests - the economy will fall into recession. Every time the Fed has raised interest rates so fast over the past half century, it has led to a recession.

&#x200B;

Moreover, the rate hikes won't make up for the main reasons for current inflation -- two years of pent-up demand from the pandemic, shortages of goods and services, Putin's war in Ukraine, and large, profitable companies with enough pricing to use inflation as a cover to further The power to push up prices.

The Fed assumes that price increases are being driven by wage growth ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúwage price inflation.‚Äù This is not correct. Wages lag behind inflation.

1614565726.0,Snack on the Sneakiest Short Squeeze of all time with UTZüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"I know what you‚Äôre thinking. A potato chip company, you gotta be kidding me. I also know you‚Äôre thinking another fucking short squeeze, but hear me out‚Ä¶ There is something VERY strange going on with this stock and I‚Äôm here to shed some light on it. 

Well listen here smooth brain because I‚Äôm not kidding and I would never fucking touch a company that moves as slowly as this stock unless I thought I could make a shitload of money. 

There is the sneakiest short squeeze of all time going on here and I‚Äôm ready to exploit it and apparently somebody else is too. 

So here it is, laid out as simply as I can put for you dumbasses. Somebody (insider, smart-money, whoever) who knows something we don‚Äôt know is betting BIG that this stock is hitting 30$ by the March 19th expiration. They have **OVER 600,000$ riding on this call that sits 5$ out of the money**\- it's the absolute definition of unusual options activity and when coupled with the fact the stock rarely has any options volume and it has ZERO upcoming public events something is about to happen and we just don‚Äôt know it yet. 

[Unusual Option Activity on 2\/17 for March 30c](https://preview.redd.it/b95j2t6bubk61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b88b935343a21aac7fb5f6d57e75ac2dffbc24)

My thoughts are pretty simple- this stock is on its way up to the fucking moon and with contracts this cheap now after a market slump the opportunity to **10X or 15X** your invest is there. Somebody knows something is going on and with UTZ ‚Äòs recent history of buying up other brands On the Border Tortilla Chips (Second leading tortilla chip brand) and Vitner‚Äôs (A Chicago based salty snack manufacturer) a merger is most likely on the horizon and undoubtedly sending this stock over 30$. This merger or announcement would send the shorts running and in an attempt to cover they‚Äôd find themselves buying back the stock at insane amounts. 

If you made it this far I bet you already are considering it so why waste your time anymore.

**TLDR: Buy March 19th 30C wait for a big random catalyst event and enjoy.**

For a deeper analysis of what I think will happen here it is:

**The most likely scenario: UTZ 32$+ Per Share 500% Return**

Unlike most of the other companies looked at on this forum UTZ actually makes money. It IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC merger and has been on a tear up over 150% since then. However, unlike your typical SPAC this company makes good money and has a good balance sheet with plenty of cash on hand. They‚Äôve been using this cash to buy other brands like crazy in hopes of expanding their market out of the mostly the northeast and midwest to the rest of the country. Their CEO Dylan Lissette has made it known on CNBC that he wants to grow the company and has aggressive plans to do so. This would lend that big better to most likely be anticipating a massive merger in the following weeks which would allow them to cash in their huge position at a massive gain. 

**The rare but plausible scenario: UTZ Short Squeeze 50$+ Per Share 5000% Return**

This will sound a little crazy but at this point I know you guys will believe anything if I put enough rockets and tell you I‚Äôll make you rich- which I am. So listen, **THIS WILL MAKE YOU RICH IF IT HAPPENS AND IT'S WORTH BETTING ON**. There is the possibility for a quick short squeeze and a subsequent gamma squeeze the likes of which would send this **WELL** stock beyond 50$. 

Here is some quick math for you:

15.23% of the stock is held by insiders.

71.26% of the stock is held by institutions. 

There are 2.95 MILLION shares SHORTED.

What this all means is that with the current amount of stock held by insiders and institutions there is only 8 millions shares free float. This becomes a big problem for the shorts very quickly if the stock price shoots up on a merger, not only because they are forced to buy back their shares BUT market makers are now involved due to the larger options orders THAT if soon become in the money will FORCE them to buy shares of the underlying stock to remain delta neutral.

As you know market makers try their best to remain delta neutral when making deals. When this big buyer came in and forced market makers to open 5,000 contracts with a delta of 0.25 they were forced to buy 25% of the shares they owed in those 5,000 contracts- to remain delta neutral as I said. 

5,000 contracts = 500,000 outstanding shares (if the contracts are in the money) 

In order to remain delta neutral they would have to purchase 125,000 shares. Which they did as seen here: When the big buy orders hit the tape at 10:11 AM we see a huge spike as market makers buy in as they need to have 125,000 shares purchased to remain delta neutral. 

[MM Big Purchase at 10:11 on 2\/17](https://preview.redd.it/gso9r544vbk61.jpg?width=1177&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cff362d577d8fe165cfc3728b8bac6b5e7cef50)

As open interest increases and we now see it nearing closer to 7,000 contracts, as the stock moves closer to 30$ more market makers will be forced to buy in and thus leave less room for the shorts to cover their asses. If buying increases and stock is held then these shorts could be on the hook for a lot of money.

Another thing you haven't realised is these increased share prices have only allowed company insiders to cash out on their holdings, **all at your expense**.

Today is a day for mourning and remembering.

u/zjz and I are entertained to the core by the tragedy of the rocketship GME. We know we share this joy with all of the people of subreddit. This is truly a global shitshow.

Twelve months ago, almost to the day, we gained millions of subscribers on a brilliant mission to the moon. But we've never lost our shirts in unison like this; we've never collectively gotten crushed like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the holders of the stock; but they, the retarded apes, were aware of the dangers, but bought shares and DRS'd them anyways. We mourn the losses millions of retards who bought high and sold low along the way.

For the families of the apes, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of the knowledge that apes are retarded. But we feel their stupidity, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, ""Give me a stock, and I'll tell all my friends to buy it."" They had a hunger to explore the markets and discover its frauds. They wished to destroy the hedgies, and they did. They destroyed Citron.

We've grown tired of the conspiracy theories on this stock. It's hard to entertain us. But for 10 years this Monday, wallstreetbets shitposting has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of high quality shitposts, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're 11.5 million shitposters strong.

And I want to say something to the paint eaters of SuperStonk who are holding onto the stock for dear life. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes other stocks exist on the market. It's all a part of having an economy with more than one company in it. It's all part of having a place for discussion that isn't a cultlike echochamber shouting the same thing over and over. The riches of the market don't belong to those who invest without doing their own research; it belongs to the DD posters who can defend their thesis against derision with verifiable facts. DeepFuckingValue and his detailed DDs was pulling us into riches, and we'll continue to do quality research that would make him proud.

I've always had great faith and respect for our DD posters, and what happened with the nonstop ""squeeze DD"" trash that followed GME does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our losses. We don't delete our incorrect DDs after the fact. We review them publicly and learn from them. That's the way high quality discussion happens, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.

We'll continue our quest for tendies. There will be more hilarious shitposts and god tier DD, and, yes, more dumb memes that people upvote for god knows why. Nothing ends once you're bankrupt; there's always someone willing to lend you money.

I want to add that I wish I could talk to every bear who posts on WSB or who submitted a trash tier meme and tell them: ""Your dedication and steadfastedness have moved and impressed us for years. Although we don't understand the nature of your brain damage, we want you to know, stocks only go up.""

There's a coincidence today. On this day 36 years ago, the great explorer Michael Smith/Scott flew the spaceship Challenger. In his lifetime the great barriers to making gains were $45 commissions for trading, and a CNBC analyst later said, ""They got their stock tips from their friends at the pub, which was a lot worse than randomly guessing."" Well, today we can say of the WSB crew: Their willingness to believe in random strangers on the internet was equally ill advised.

1617277428.0,Crash alert. Infra plan is a disappointing trojan horse for taxes,"The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...

The reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.

First here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:

**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\**

**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.

**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace ‚Äúan ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.‚Äù It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.

**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to ‚Äúthe very largest corporations.‚Äù

**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly

territorial tax systems.

BAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$

**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, ""would reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.""

That 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.

Parker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.

==============================================

The only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*

>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do ""everything we possibly can"" to pay for it. He said there should be ""tax adjustments"" to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.

[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949)

## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.

Moving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :

the phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.

## BUY ED DEC 2022

and the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.

Parker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.

==============================================

The only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*

>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do ""everything we possibly can"" to pay for it. He said there should be ""tax adjustments"" to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.

[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949)

## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.

Moving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :

the phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.

## BUY ED DEC 2022

and the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.

TLDR

**SHORT USDJPY, USDCHF, USDGBP**

**LONG GLD, QQQ vs DIA, TLT**

**BUY SPX OTM PUTS**"

1669140944.0,UPDATE: I may have single handedly saved my local GameStop üöÄüöÄüöÄ,"**This is an update to** [**the original post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ytcgx9/i_may_have_single_handedly_saved_my_local_gamestop/) **from about 10 days ago**

After the rousing support I received from the community, I went back to check up on things at the store. This time, I brought along a clipboard so that I could document my findings and try out the demerit system that me and some of the guys (also ladies ;\]) on the SuperStonk discord server came up with for our retail employees.

I approached the storefront and pushed open both doors at the same time like an old-timey saloon. **They didn't make a sound. Not a squeak** \- GameStop has some seriously high quality doors guys.

""Hey there, welcome in."" shouted an employee from the back of the store.

I confidently strode up to address them at the counter, glancing around the store for any issues with nothing jumping out at me.""Not bad, kid,"" I remarked to him. ""Not bad at all. Looking pretty good in here. Is the manager around?"".

Visibly confused he said ""Uh, I'm the manager. Is something wrong?"".

""No, no, no, just wanted to ensure that we have a manager on duty, as it's part of the checklist.""

""Checklist?"" he asked. ""What checklist?"".

""The checklist that we the shareholders have drawn up for our retail employees. It's mostly the same stuff you've aways done, but now there's a demerit system so that we can track and punish employees for bad behavior/poor performance.""

He began to shake his head & choke out a response, but I abruptly cut him off.

""Anyway, I gotta jet. Keep up the good work, and maybe you'll get a nice NFT bonus for Christmas.""

I turned on my heel to leave when lo and behold - who do I see but the kid from last time, walking in late watching TikToks on his phone.

""Well, well, well,"" I smugly said, crossing my arms with a smirk dancing across my lips. ""Look who decided to show up.""

The kid looked up in surprise and his eyes immediately grew to the size of dinner plates.

""That's the guy!"" he shouted to the manager behind me. ""That's the guy I told you about the other day, the one from corporate"".

""You work at the corporate office?"" the manager asked me.

""Not physically, but I am however a partial owner of the company"".

""Dude, look, you don't work here,"" he suggested. ""I don't care if you own a couple of shares or whatever, you can't be coming in here being rude to us. Why do you care so much about this place anyway?"".

Now, I'm not a very big guy (5'4 ¬æ), but I sized him up and was pretty sure that if push came to shove I could take him.

""Why do I care?"" I mirrored back to him, stealthily adjusting my feet into a fighting stance. ""Ever heard of a dark pool? How about a short ladder? Maybe a cellar box? No? Well that's is what we're up against, **and it's a fucking war.** You think that hiring little piss worms like this kid right here who come in late every day and allows people steal Funko Pops anytime they want is helping the battle? That's a demerit. Congrats on earning the first one in GameStop history, kid.""

He threatened to call the police, so I chose to be the bigger person and leave as to not disturb any customers when they begin to pour in.

**TLDR;** I was able to weed out a bad manager at a GameStop location who didn't align with our values as shareholders. I will be calling the corporate office to demand his termination, as well as request to participate in the interview for his replacement.

1657212447.0,GME stock dividend is not the same as stock split dammit!!!,"EDIT:

ok lets go back to basic math.

If there is 1000 share. and gme declare 1 dollar dividend per share

and there is 200 share that is shorted.

short seller need to pay the dividend, which is 200 dollar.

&#x200B;

so now, will GME pay out 800 dollar or 1000 dollar?

clearly only 800 right? because the other 200, already got paid by short seller.

&#x200B;

or are you saying gme pay 1000 in dividend, and short seller pay 200. for a total of 1200 in dividend?

&#x200B;

so what is it? will gme pay 800 in dividend, and short seller pay 200

or will gme pay 1000 and short seller pay 200?

&#x200B;

we all know gme does not pay 1000, short seller pay 200 because that would be an extra 200 of dividend that doesnt go anywhere,

we know short seller has to pay 200 in dividend.

that mean, gme ONLY need to come up with 800 in dividend, not 1000.

&#x200B;

hopefully all the people that say i am wrong can figure out the logic, but then we are on WSB so probably not. LOL

&#x200B;

EDIT EDIT:

ok so 1000 share. 1 dollar dividend. assume only 1 person own all 1000 share.

A get 1000 in dividend.

S borrow 200 share. and they sold it to B

B now own 200 ""borrowed share""

S need to pay 200 to B for dividend.

S need to pull $200 out of his ass, to pay B. does S go back to A and say hey let me borrow 200 to pay B? nope, he get it from his ass. This cost him $200 dollar.

&#x200B;

So now, change it to stock dividend.

A get 1000 stock as dividend from GME

S borrow 200 share, sold it to B

B now own 200 share. and need to receive 200 share in dividend from S

S need to pull out 200 share from his ass to give to B. His ass doesn't have any. he can't get it from his ass. So he goes back to his buddy A, and say he you got some extra share, I need to borrow it also. A goes what the hell? when money was given, you pull it out of your ass, but now it's shares, your ass don't have it huh? and you want to borrow it from me? ok, but it will be 1 million ok? you know, supply, demand, times are changing, inflation, i need to pay my wife's BF??

1612258336.0,Going against the grain and looking at possible exits for GME in the worst case,"This is probably going to get downvoted to oblivion but after being very bullish last Thursday I have **changed** my opinion over the weekend and yesterday.

&#x200B;

It seems a lot of people here are emotional and are just in it to stick to wallstreet. 

Personally, I am not part of wallstreetbets to stick it to anyone or to make myself be a martyr for any cause. I am in it to make money. While I personally support a lot of views here and the blatant bs that is happening in form of **market manipulation**, brokers like RH having issues with their **clearing houses** (or so they claim) and **restricting trading**, **media**, and a bunch of other infuriating factors makes me pissed too. 

However, hijacking the sub just for GME and not burying all other DD is just dumb. 

&#x200B;

**But the moment you start investing with your emotions you lose.**

At the moment I feel extremely blind since I do not know what is real and what is manufactured info and we do not know the real short interest. **That plus all these emotions from people here is** making me uneasy.

&#x200B;

# I am trying to look for a potential exit.

Based on the short interest reported being so low, it seems a lot of shorts have covered their positions (this could be manipulated data but we have to go on what we have). It seems they did most of their covering AH and during retail sell-offs that they artificially created by manipulating the price in AH.

&#x200B;

# Retail vs Institution change in the charts:

It does seem that most of retail has gotten in on Monday and Tuesday and that after that it was institutions playing their games. You can see this by how radically different the graphs look for days after Tuesday of last week.

&#x200B;

[Volume and the movement of price is completely different after Wednesday  which makes me think it is institutions and other hedge funds that got it to trade volatility, notice the massive price gaps AH ](https://preview.redd.it/evdnw7xd71f61.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=5594df708bbf563cc18f4e1ddf06d53139fdb54d)

&#x200B;

This with the addition of restriction of retail buyers is making me bearish because I believe that the shorts managed to get out during this time and the new shorts got in while the older ones blew up earlier and have covered during AH.

&#x200B;

# Supports to avoid shakeouts:

It seems that the last support level around $160 range if broken is what would trigger me to sell. There was one wick that went as low as $110 on the 28th, this is a problem because during the free fall of the breakers it broke through the $160 support like nothing yet recovered. Setting a stop loss at $160 could cause your position to just be shaken out. But setting your stop loss at $110 or below is too low imo but could be a reasonable stop loss to prevent getting shaken out of your position if you believe the short squeeze is still coming.

&#x200B;

[Trying to avoid getting shaken out at $110, this was probably their test to see how low they can flash crash the price to pick up as many shares if they were to cover their shorts.](https://preview.redd.it/bxtxqa4n71f61.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=567bd77db52fe4b7a2bc4b5664664f36944d1e7f)

&#x200B;

# Comparison with VW in 2008

The balancing act here is finding the sweet spot where you will not get shaken out in case the data is manipulated and the squeeze rockets to $1000+/share but also not to be low enough that your losses are massive.

&#x200B;

If you are more conservative I would take the profits around 160, if you want to potentially wait for squeeze and not get shaken out $110 seems like a reasonable stop loss.

Depending on the pre-market sentiment by morning I will be looking to either get out at 160 or holding.

&#x200B;

I am not trying to scare anyone just trying to do my own exit strategy, Do your own research. I do not have a crystal ball. After the official short interest is released I may look to reenter the position in GME if I get out, but profit is profit till then.

From my previous prediction (I got shit on predicting Russia will invade and to by boil), I believe everything runs on game theory.

Edit: I didn‚Äôt go into the game theory, I briefly mentioned it. Biden and allies vs putin. They have interdependent decisions to make. But ah well, forgot this is wsb and everyone is a regard, ie I should have spelled it out. But google game theory and understand the full context of what is happening 

So from recent events, I‚Äôm back to posting about game theory and predict what will happen.

1. The war is nearly over
2. It‚Äôll cause oil to dump hard
3. World will enter deflation since we have supply surpluses and abundant energy and oil.
4. Fed will pivot
5. QE will begin
6. Ukraine will be the next money pit
7. Biden will be re-elected 

Main is number 1. Putin only has 2 options now, nuke or negotiate. US and nato allies know this, so they‚Äôll push until they know they can‚Äôt anymore anymore and pivot to negotiations. Biden will ‚Äúbroker‚Äù the negotiation. It‚Äôll cause Russia to start selling oil again. Saudi‚Äôs will be scared that US and Russia are on talking terms again and begin to let the oil flow. (Not sure if Biden will hold a grudge against Saudi Arabia, they may).

Oil and gas will drop insanely. That coupled with surplus supply and unemployment happening, fed will have to pivot.

Depending on how mad unemployment actually is, fed may have to cut interest rates and may have pause QT.

I expect stock market to fly, but if for some reason it doesn‚Äôt, QE will happen.

Biden will use ending the war and reversing inflation. They‚Äôll also blame inflation of trump.

Biden will get re-elected.

Mainly, the conflict only has 2 ways to go now, Putin pushes the button or Putin stops the war. Since this is a 0 sum game, the war will end.

Caveat, if putin is actually sick and doesn‚Äôt give a f about anything, buy a bunker! ü§£",wallstreetbets,"Game Theory: The war will end soon, oil will plummet, Biden will get re-elected r/wallstreetbets/comments/sshs8f/game_theory_putin_will_invade_ukraine_what_stocks

This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance.

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

1670385545.0,"Tesla will be the Myspace of the EV market. Tesla Semi will not change that, just like Myspace music did not save Myspace.","TL:DR - Tesla is only #1 in EV because they were first. Their market share will only decrease from here, Tesla Semi will not change that, in 5 years they will not even be a top 5 EV manufacturer.

Tesla created the EV market, no one can deny that. Companies become market makers by creating and cornering a market before there is real competition, then staying ahead of the newcomers.

New companies try to create new markets all the time. Few are successful. Even fewer create truly NEW markets, most are just iterations past old norms. EV vehicles are not a new market, they are an iteration on the norms of the consumer vehicle market. This means Tesla not only has to defend against newcomers to the consumer electric vehicle space, but they have to compete against very successful consumer vehicle manufacturers altering their established brands in EV's.

The F-150 is best selling truck, for decades, period. In the USA trucks have an exceptionally loyal customer base, and oversized market share. What Loyal Ford or Chevy owner would choose the cyber truck over the Lightning or Silverado EV? Its rhetorical moron, everyone knows there is not enough to be statistically relevant.

Tesla is only #1 in the EV space because they created that market and have not yet had to face real world competition. During that time they have failed to establish a market cornering brand. Right now Ford, Chevrolet, and Hyundai/Kia are all competing to be #2 in the EV market had have openly stated their intention to be #1 in the EV space in the next 5 years or so.

Before trying to mumble something about ""Tesla's innovation"" around Elon's dick, stop and think about this example. When Toyota entered the truck market they created a new ""small truck"" market. The overwhelming success of the Toyota truck that was eventually named the Tacoma launched them to success in the truck market. Nissan and other imports jumped on the small truck market, but the Nissan offering never hit it big in that space, Why? Because Ford launched the Ranger and Chevrolet the S10 and quickly claimed the #2 and #3 spots. Toyota is still a dominant player in ""small trucks"", but only barely and never managed to corner that market, and they were already a reputable and trusted car brand when they created that marked. Toyota is only dominant in the ""small"" truck space, their larger truck offerings cant come close to the F-150 or Silverado. Tesla was not a reputable or trusted manufacturer when they created this market, and I would argue still are not reputable or trustworthy. Look at Elon, he wasted $44 billion buying a social media company, just so he can ruin his reputation faster than he was by just being a social media user, how does that inspire trust in the brand?!?

Tesla Semi is not their savior, it is proof they are the Myspace of the social media world. Tesla created a market where no one thought one would exist (or so oil propaganda had everyone convinced), but now that the value behind the market has been established, how can Tesla out compete Ford or Toyota? All of Tesla's profitable models are in the ""luxury"" space where the margins are higher. Tesla is struggling to produce their still very expensive economy"" model 3, which can not compete against true ""economy"" EV's like the Leaf. Eventually Mercedes EV's will be preferred in the luxury EV space and the model 3 will never be able to compete with a Civic EV or Corolla EV. I am planning to buy an EV in 2024 and if there is a Civic EV, the Model 3 would have to have equal quality, and a LOWER price to even be considered, and would still also have to compete with Leaf etc. Why? Because Nissan entered the EV market years after Tesla, yet their very first EV, offered 2014, still sets a standard for quality/reliability in the EV space that Tesla can not equal even in 2021.

http://imgur.com/a/ffJNaC0

TL;DR: investors have been blaming negative price action on illegal naked shorting for decades. Modern day apes are using the same, rehashed arguments as their predecessors who fell for similar pump and dumps.

I recently went down a rabbit hole after reading the recent posts on SS about CMKM. Apes claim this case is evidence that trillions of ""fake shares"" are possible. I found the above article which perfectly describes the similar situation some CMKM investors found themselves in after the fraud committed by CMKM execs was exposed. Rather than accept their losses, they held onto the lie that it was all the fault of naked short sellers.

To be clear, I don't believe there has been any fraud at the GME exec level. The parallels I draw are between the investors that refuse to accept reality, and rather blame everything on naked short selling. In GME's case the fraudsters, in my opinion, are the DD writers. They recklessly mislead apes in fields they have no experience in. They misinterpret data and con the unknowing into believing a financial conspiracy. Not to mention the shameless self promotion of their paid services and fund raisers that we have seen from some mods.

Further parallels can be seen in the below article which states ""Some pranced around the offices of the villainous Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. in 2005 (I work there, according to these morons), made damned fools of themselves and diverted scarce police resources.""

The article references another similar case, that of Universal Exchange. This is another example of a company exec using the excuse of naked short sellers to defraud investors.

I find it quite hilarious that in the comments of the above article there are people making the same arguments as modern day apes. There are references to rule changes, rigging allegations, references to FTDs and allegations of people working for naked shorters.

The former CEO of Universal Express was sentenced to prison for securities fraud in 2014, by the way.

I also found the fantastic article below. I'm not sure when it was written (I think around 2010), but it details this sort of thing happening since the 1990s. I particularly like this quote: ""many fall prey to hysterical hoopla purporting to explain how naked shorting is responsible¬†for the untimely deaths of ‚Äútens of thousands‚Äù of worthy startup companies, and will even one day cause the collapse of the global economy.""

TL;DR: investors have been blaming negative price action on illegal naked shorting for decades. Modern day apes are using the same, rehashed arguments as their predecessors who fell for similar pump and dumps.

I recently went down a rabbit hole after reading the recent posts on SS about CMKM. Apes claim this case is evidence that trillions of ""fake shares"" are possible. I found the above article which perfectly describes the similar situation some CMKM investors found themselves in after the fraud committed by CMKM execs was exposed. Rather than accept their losses, they held onto the lie that it was all the fault of naked short sellers.

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.

Everyone knows ‚ÄúFord‚Äù there‚Äôs rumors a merger with Tesla but I don‚Äôt think it would ever happen the brand ‚ÄúFord‚Äù is like Disney to famous be acquired but it‚Äôs a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Seriously go google Mache-e.

The new Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy company and brands which = consumer loyalty. Has factories in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn‚Äôt any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.

Vehicles cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn‚Äôt get anymore.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Some great comments that were posted in the last DD below

You need more reasons to buy and hold stocks here? Car discounts for share holders!!! [Discount - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/leWoGTB) you need 100 shares and hold them for 6 months min

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* A 500 billion dollar investment and partial ownership of Rivian, a member of the Ford family on Rivian's board of trustees, and a partnership with Rivian to be able to use Rivian's skateboard (R1T, R1S) platform.
* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.
* Owns SPIN, the scooter company.
* Massive ICE F-150 profits instead of Tesla shareholders and tax credits to fund their EV and autonomous plans.

I called Ford over 10 dollars 3 to 4 months ago."" MSUconservative

‚ÄúNot to mention they're one of 3 companies in the running for a multi billion dollar deal with the USPS to manufacture EV mail trucks and they have the strongest chance at getting it considering their history providing vehicles for the government and that one of the other companies is a European company.‚Äù caeshx

Gear boxes and other parts that will need to be maintained on other EV Trucks will allow the Endurance to be hands-down the lowest cost vehicle. In addition, the ability to move quicker than the Big 3 positions us well and early in the market.

‚úÖ Rich Schmidt, Lordstown President confirms, Lordstown is fully funded through May 2022 with millions extra in the bank. There is additional fundraising happening to ramp up production, because hard tooling requires 50-51 week advanced and paid order before required. In order to continue to improve production with hard tooling, we will continue to work with ATVM Loan funding and asset-backed funding.

‚úÖ Current interest is at an expected 20,000 non-binding orders through May 2022.

‚úÖ The hub motors have been fully tested on street driving, and we have not been able to break a hub motor. You will break a wheel before you break a hub motor. They are built very much for difficult road conditions.

‚úÖ 600 employees are hired on to support operations across Lordstown locations.

‚úÖ Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded. Final certification test will be early fourth quarter. Vehicles will be produced in September and quarantined until final certification is released, at which time the vehicles will be delivered to customers.

‚úÖ There is a Lordstown VAN prototype that is in final stages of completion completed, which will be shown this summer. The prototype is set up to use same products, build, and platforms as the Endurance.

‚úÖ The cost for the Endurance will be at $55,000. There is a minimal parts supply cost increase due to covid. The average vehicle increase has been $4,000 across the industry.

‚úÖ Vehicles will be available for press and investors to drive at Lordstown Week, onsite June 21 - 25.

‚úÖ Lordstown will continue an open culture; engaging with the team and it's up to the employees and Lordstown family to seek unionization or not... Every team member owns shares in the company, we enjoy providing free meals, and each day we work hand and hand with all Lordstown employees.

1615178879.0,Don't expect GME to become worth more than the combined market cap of all other stocks on the planet,"I totally expect to wake up tomorrow with a negative karma for posting this but man it needs to be said.

The total market cap of all stocks IN THE WORLD combined is about 100 trillion.

It was cute for a bit when everyone was echoing 100k which would put GME at a market cap of 7 trillion. Personally I highly doubt this will happen and will not count on it.

But now the clamor is up to 500k which would be a third of the market cap of the world. Not going to happen.

Soon they will be calling for 1 million which would be 70 trillion almost as much as the market cap of ALL OTHER STOCKS COMBINED and about 40% more than all the stocks in the USA. That will not happen. The HFs won't physically be able to buy shares for that much.

And I don't want to hear how Berskshire A is almost 400k. They only have 1.5 million shares and make a profit of tens of billions of dollars per year. If they had the 70 mil shares that GME has it would be at only 7k.

It is only a matter of time before people are calling for 5 million or 10 million. Don't listen to them. That is nutzzzzzz. 10 mil would put market cap of GME at 700 trillion which is HALF THE NET WORTH OF PLANET EARTH. That is not going to happen. Not possible.

Here is how I see it and nothing here is financial advice and I am not a financial advisor... There s a 99% chance that I get it wrong somehow either to the upside or downside.

1k is likely.

2k is very possible

5k is possible as well but I think a bit of a reach, but it could happen for sure.

10k is a bit of a reach but still possible.

20k not likely

50k very unlikely. It would make GME worth almost double apple.

100k just not going to happen.

500k is a delusion

1 mil is just stupid wishful thinking

suggesting 5 million is going to get people hurt.

If you are counting on 100k expect to be disappointed and expect to walk away with nothing but the shares you hold forever (although I put the long term price of GME at pretty close to where it is now).

If I were to advise anyone anything it is this:

1. have a plan
2. have a plan
3. have a plan

I cannot stress the first 3 enough.

4) don't sell all at once. Most likely you did not buy all at once and the last shares you buy will most likely be the best buy (maybe not by % but by timing)

5) count on: whatever you think in terms of peak $ and peak time will probably be wrong; so plan accordingly

6) be ready to tweak plan if things start to look differently

So for now here is my plan just to give an example but you do you (as Shakespeare wrong, This above all to thine own self be true)

my first sell will probably be around 1k. I will sell probably 100 of my 220 shares (which I might turn around and buy back on a big dip). For my oldest boy's education fund I will sell about 30 of his 100. For my youngest boy sell 10 of his 50.

At 2k I sell 100 more shares keeping 20 and giving me 300k cash which I would be very happy with.

I sell 60 of my oldest boys remaining giving him 10 left and 170k in his account and 10 more years for me to raise it (lets face it 170k would put him through college...).

I sell 35 of my youngest boys giving him 5 left and 80k cash and 14 years to get him enough to go to college.

At 10k I sell all of my boys remaining shares. I sell 25 of my last 30. I hold the last 5 of my shares until I feel we are at the peak or just past the peak.

Also to note once I sell shares and have cash I will be selling puts to make some more cash. I will keep doing this until GME months from now goes back to the 50-60 range and the squeeze is over and a lot of people move on from GME. At some point I will get assigned in that range and pick up probably about 1000 shares for me and a couple of hundred for each of my boys to hold long term. I won't be able to sell puts for my boys until I get their accounts transferred to TD ameritrade.

The plaintiffs claim the CFO colluded with other insiders to pump the stock. 

If we look at BBBY insider sales, there‚Äôs only one seller aside from the CFO, Ryan Cohen.

A few weeks ago others in the industry also requested RC be investigated by the SEC and filed official complaints: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/former-hedge-fund-manager-calls-out-ryan-cohen-s-bed-bath-beyond-trade-complains-to-sec-what-a-total-disgrace-1031694141

Essentially, RC is most likely the target of the lawsuit along with the CFO who is now dead.

I‚Äôm not saying RC did insider trading, but I think it‚Äôs safe to say he will be heavily targeted by this lawsuit and probably the SEC. It‚Äôs up to them to prove he did it. 

Either way, I suspect significant negative sentiment coming out from the media about RC, bbby, and gme.

I have watched from the side lines as you all have talked for the last year or so about how revolutionary you are being by demanding the transfer agents of the companies in which you own stock move your shares from the street names of your brokers to your own registered names at AST, ComputerShare, EQ (pre-merger) etc. Here is an example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate\_wall\_street/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb1b6w/checkmate_wall_street/) 

My impression has been, wow, these people really have no idea how absolutely insignificant this move is to the brokers weighed against the negative effects it is likely to have on their companies, whose expenses for administering this increased number of registered SHs are going to go up substantially.

Now I'm starting to see the rubber meet the road. This week I saw the first invoices from Broadridge for annual meeting services this year, which are up 35-65% for  my clients because their registered shareholder pool has gone up by, depending on the client, hundreds/thousands of individuals/entities because of your ""movement."" I guess you don't realize that for every new registered shareholder, the company has to pay like $1,000 extra each year to Broadridge for searches, report tabulation, voting, mailing proxy statements and cards, mailing annual reports, etc. not to mention many issuers are now exceeding the limits of the transfer agent contracts so they are paying per SH out the ass to AST/Computershare. I am seeing company's annual meeting bills and transfer agent quarterly invoices go up by $100,000s for absolutely no reason. I can only imagine how crazy the transfer agent/Broadridge bills are this year for a true meme stock like GME; I assume at least $1 million.

I really have no skin in this game other than the solvency of my clients so they can pay my invoices and I don't really care either way really except I think it's funny to point out that by taking this untutored stance against your brokers who, trust me, don't give a shit whether your 23 GME shares are on their books or AST's, you are actually costing the companies you are trying to long literally hundreds of thousands of dollars for basically no reason (not to mentioned the poor beleagured stock administration teams at your portfolio companies who are like, ""wait, what someone wants to hold 7 shares at AST, that's like 20 minutes of paperwork I didn't need or want to add to my plate"").

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It‚Äôs unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we‚Äôre reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

EWT says we‚Äôre reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term.

1690505364.0,$DISH is extremely undervalued,"So I got into $DISH because of the Dish guy on here a few days ago, but before buying into it, I wanted to make sure it was a good company and I wasn't buying into trash. 

I've bought into FRC, AMC, WISH, SOS, TLRY, RAD and many other meme stocks here, so it's fair to say I'm regarded and I've made and lost a lot of money on my stupid plays but I have told myself I am done playing stupid and I need to invest in better companies. 

So despite the news of Dish selling phone plans on Amazon, I looked at their balance sheet, and I feel this is one of the most undervalued companies on the market. 

Because many regards here don't look at the balance sheet, let's take a close look. 

As of last quarter they have

Cash on hand: $2.54B

Total long term debt: $20.53B

Total liabilities: $35.38B

Total assets $56.562B

Total Shareholder Equity: $18.183B (AFTER debt)

Current market cap: $3.72B

In the last year, they've made over 5 billion in profit, as a failing company, their total profit is less than the market cap of the company. How often do you find a company that has made over 5 billion, offers over 18B in book value, trading for under 4 billion? it's a steal.

A lot of that debt has been added over the last few years as they've built out their 5G network to compete with other providers along with purchasing Boost Mobile from Sprint for $1.4 billion.

As you can see even with what customer base is left after all the cord cutting, and now with the new Amazon deal, they are still a very profitable company. They are trading as if they are going to spiral into bankruptcy, but as of right now unless something changes, they are a profitable company that is able to pay all its debts, on top of that, even if shareholder equity was only $10 billion, it's still trading at 3 times less than it should be, the book value as of right now is over 18 billion, yet it's trading at 3.72B, it's a steal. 

I also believe that this is a trial period of Amazon selling their Sim cards and cell phone services through their website, if Amazon sees that they are selling well and doing well through Amazon, I believe Dish will have a good chance of being acquired by Amazon, but I believe Amazon wants to see how well they do first before taking that leap, but even if they do, Amazon would be buying a profitable company, that they could integrate into their own services with Prime Video and a 5G network already built out as most of the leg work has already been done.

Even if Amazon never acquires them and that isn't the play (which I totally believe will happen eventually) the big play here is this, they are still a very profitable company, they realize that they are losing customers at a rapid pace on their Dish network services and they've noticed it for a while, so now they are trying to transition to a cell phone provider while they still are making money from their satellite company to roll this transition out.

Lastly, I do expect a decent earnings here as their last earnings was a disaster with over 552,000 people that left due to a cyberattack that left their entire network down for a week, I believe there will be some decline in the satellite division, but I also expect them to push their new cell phone and 5G net work as the future of the company, as even if they were to sell the network they built out alone with 5G, it would be worth more than the debt and 3.72B market cap this is currently trading at. I believe people will finally see the value that they are bringing to the table and the stock will jump to the $10-12 range. 

The IV is also higher on the call side than put side, and it's been that way for a bit, so I think even the hedge funds know this is undervalued and expect it to go higher. 

I could be wrong, so do your own DD. I'm holding through earnings and jumping ship if I am wrong. 

Position 7,400 shares - yes I'm a bag holder but my DD stands, and I know when to cut my losses, so troll me if you want lol

tl:dr - Dish Network is undervalued, they are transitioning into a new industry and already built a lot of the 5G network out to over 240 million Americans (70% of the population) that alone would be worth it for Amazon or some other big player to purchase off of them. The company isn't going bankrupt, but they're being priced as they are.

The US economy is BOOMING. Housing is slowly recovering, rent price are also slowly normalizing. Goods and services are now extremely profitable even when accounting for inflation.

I am a normal person, and let me tell you how I see things from the road.

I went for a short drive and saw 20-30 trucks hauling heavy ass loads. Gas and diesel are way down from their peaks. Everyone was out there enjoying summer, building shit, buying shit, and eating shit.

The soft landing is here.

The Yellow Cab trucking company went under, but they'll be the last. It was due to decades of poor management.

Smaller companies and owner operators have been getting created for almost 2 years now. 

What does that mean for you?

Trucking is the only way everyone in the country can have access to goods AND services that use any kind of tools or materials. If they are making money and have work, it will soon translate into you and the companies you work for, going down the same path--of making a shit ton of money.

1608694267.0,GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.,"So with GME running the myth of the inevitable short squeeze has popped up again.  In order for this to happen a ton of people need to short the stock naked.  Which among competent investors is really fucking rare.  I will walk through it below but you can also click this link:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/021715/how-protect-short-position-options.asp

For example let‚Äôs assume you wanted to short GME today at $20 a share.  So you sell 100 shares short at $20 each.  With a naked short you have unlimited losses as the stock runs up.  Nobody who knows what the fuck they are doing is going to do that when you can hedge to cap that loss.  A single January 21 call at a strike of 21 had a high of 2.42 today would hedge that just fine.

You short the shares and buy the call.  Your break even is now 17.68 on your short but your max loss is now $342 without borrowing costs assuming it closes at $20.99 on expiry.  Call expiring worthless for loss of $242 and $99 to cover the short.  

Borrowing costs on 100 shares at 20% and stock at 20 is about $1 a day.  Assuming everything is held to expiry with the January expiry would be about $25.

So max loss regardless of how high the stock goes is less than $400.

Your break even is kind of ass but that‚Äôs because you are protected until mid Jan.  However if IV is particularly high, even if the stock goes down pushing your return on the short up, the call might still retain enough value that your break even is much higher.  

If it‚Äôs a short term play which a short on today would likely be, you could buy a call for Friday which had a high of 1.15 today which puts your break even at 18.85 assuming you hold until Friday at close.  Factoring in borrowing cost it‚Äôs 18.8.  

That‚Äôs a hedged short which likely the vast , vast majority of GME shorts are.  Have you not noticed how fucking expensive relatively speaking call options are even with the spikes. A 20c at close with 1.5 days to expiry had a break even at 20.72 with a volume of 30,000.  Now part of that is people buying lottos but a ton of that is covering shorts.

So the whole premise of there are millions of shares that are short at $5 or $7 is some serious bullshit.  Yes there were 70m shares short give or take 2m at the end of October and there were the same number of shares short at the end of November.  This does not mean they are the same fucking people shorting it. Some have covered, some executed hedges and others have sold that shit short at higher prices.

For example today alone 8m shares were shorted.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

Yesterday there were 3m shares shorted.  Borrowing rates are in the 20% range, which works out to around $1 total per 100 shares.  Or a single fucking tick downward.  So no institutions aren‚Äôt going to be covering shares they shorted at $15 when it spikes to $19.

But why has it been spiking if it‚Äôs not a short squeeze, and that‚Äôs really fucking simple, a ton of people are playing the momentum on it.  Hell 10% of the daily thread is people spamming to buy shares and you can make some money provided you don‚Äôt buy the top.  Its not a coincidence that they announce the stimulus and the stock spiked and I would be willing to bet that the vast majority of shares bought today were through Robinhood.

But Cohen you say?  He added another 3%, yeah he added 3% directly on the dip after earnings.  He‚Äôs in at $12 - $13 range based off the timings of the 13d.  If you are wondering what happens if he decides that the board isn‚Äôt being accommodating enough and drops his shares look at what happened the day Buffet said he was dropping airlines.  He can eat the ride down to $13 and still be profitable.

Then finally the biggest piece to the short squeeze is long term positive catalysts, the last significant short squeeze came from ACB two earnings ago when they closed the gap on their loss and cancelled their at the money offering.  At that point the long term growth story fundamentally changed as did the state of the business.  That‚Äôs what it takes to force a short squeeze, doubling e-commerce sales when overall sales are still massively down isn‚Äôt going to cut it.  A slightly green quarter during the launch of multiple new consoles isn‚Äôt going to do it either.  Now if they follow that with another solidly profitable quarter in May, at that point a squeeze is possible.


TL:DR:  The infinite short squeeze on GameStop is a bullshit argument assuming basic competence from anyone shorting the stock.  Options were in fact originally designed to offset the risks of shorting.  It will go up as long as more people are willing to become bagholders, just don‚Äôt be shocked when it comes crashing down.  It also explains the crazy ass high IV on call options.",wallstreetbets,"GME short squeeze is a myth that assumes massive incompetence from people that actually know what they are doing.

I work in small molecule drug development, trying to find new drugs for new biology to treat old diseases. It's far worse than a search for a needle in a haystack. More like a molecule of water in an ocean. Most drug companies will start by screening millions and millions of molecules followed by an intensive drug optimization campaign to mitigate liabilities like hepato- and renal-tox, ion channel inhibition, protein binding, bioavailability, etc. You often wind up (after spending ~$50 million dollars) with thousands of different chemicals from which you are lucky to get one. If you want a good example of what a very successful drug looks like, here's Lipitor:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atorvastatin

Meanwhile, Cassava did none of that. If you look at their original patents from the early 2000s, they were looking for something that would work in the opioid pathway. They screened nothing, and somehow magicked simufilam out of thin air. There was no optimization, no intensive toxicology screening. No orthogonal binding assays. There is no x-ray crystal structure of where it binds. All of this to say - they have nothing. None of the data that even a first year graduate student would ask about. Just look at the molecule!
 https://www.medchemexpress.com/simufilam.html
It's a greasy little turd with more chemical liabilities than you could shake a stick at. The mere idea that this could have a pM affinity is laughable when the most potent drugs on the market are 1000 times less potent.

You. You are an individual. As an individual, you are a basic economic unit. As a basic economic unit, you are responsible for contributing economic activity, managing your personal resources, and maximizing utility. Utility means two things in being a productive member of society AND by being content with your lifestyle. This has been studied for generations and is taught as personal finance or even home economics.

As an individual or a family, it is in your best interest to ensure you have adequate liquidity. This liquidity will allow you to meet your short term financial obligations and even your long term financial obligations. Most people talk about an emergency find which should be 6 months to 1 year of your complete living expenses. For most adults in the U.S. this figure is a minimum of $30,000 per individual in cash, either physical or in a checking account that can be quickly accessed. Most of you probably do not have these resources available. If you do not, then you should immediately stop gambling and save every red cent.

At the time of this writing, the total value of the US stock market was approximately 100 Trillion USD...maybe more. However, the total circulating supply of USD in the world was approximately 20.4 Trillion USD. That means that 80% of the total stock market value is illusory and nonexistent. This is why during 2008 and 2020 there was such a run on financial markets. Everyone was cashing in to get raw cash! The problem then, and the problem now, is that there isn‚Äôt enough money to go around. When the next market meltdown happens, it will be far more pronounced as everyone tries to convert their funny money assets into real money. This is one of the reasons why there is such a growing disparity between the rich and the poor. The poor give their money to the rich and then wonder why they are poor. 

Anyway, everyone knows that stock prices are super overvalued, bond prices are super overvalued, real estate is super overvalued. The only thing that is not yet overvalued, is USD.

If you are less than 30 years old, you do not get to have an opinion on inflation or the value of the USD. You simply have not lived enough to know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about. Period. All of the ‚Äúprecious‚Äù metal bugs are getting their shit pushed in by JPow‚Äôs green dildo. There is inflation, but it‚Äôs in every asset class from bond prices, stonk prices, and real estate prices‚Ä¶not in cash. Cash is the only thing with intrinsic value because that is what we all use as a medium of exchange. It‚Äôs also what each and every one of us care about at the end of the day. Period. Every other asset is only made up of extrinsic value nowadays which is why meme stocks have been in the the driver seat. Finally, the only way the USD will stop being of any value is if the United States collapses. If that happens, you will have bigger personal issues to deal with than literally ALL of your assets going to 0. Moving on.

Boomers hold most of the wealth in the United States. They also have most of their wealth tied up in the stock market and real estate market. Most boomers will be retiring en masse and as they do retire, they will be converting their mutual funds and stocks into cold hard cash. This will have a ripple effect that will make equity prices go down. While you‚Äôre stuffing real money into the slot machines of the stock market casino, boomers are gleefully taking that money from you and putting it in their pockets. The boomers didn‚Äôt take your money‚Ä¶you gave it to them. Further, as they begin retiring, and they have already begun, they will keep taking your money as they sell their shares to you.

Also, look at the velocity of money. The velocity of money has been in decline since the GFC and has dropped from 10.6 in 2008 all the way down to 1.18 in 2021. Shit is going to get crazy as the real economy is still fucked and there will be a reckoning soon. Soon means anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. Nobody has a crystal ball but anyone that looks around can see it. Make no mistake, it IS coming. Make sure you are properly positioned so you don‚Äôt get fucking rekt when it does. You recently saw how the market sold off over 1% last week at just the hint of the Fed talking about thinking about tapering asset purchases. That doesn‚Äôt even address the fed funds rate. Interest rates will have to go up soon. When they do, even by .25%, it will make EVERYTHING lose value. Burry was right when he called this the greatest speculative bubble of all time and that the market is dancing on a knife‚Äôs edge. Do not let yourself get fucked by the idiocy of those in power.

IDGAF what you think about this, because at the end of the day, YOU and YOU ALONE have to live with yourself and your personal circumstances. It‚Äôs no skin off my ass if I see you on a street corner begging for change. I‚Äôve already met some of you who‚Äôve YOLO‚Äôd it all right into homelessness. I warned you. If this saves one idiot from gambling their live savings away on this negative sum game, then that is enough for me.

Takeaways: sell all your shit now and convert it all into USD. Hold it in money market funds or your checking account. As long as you have quick access to it for use in your personal life. If you have dependents, then get the fuck off of WSB and get your family financially prepared. I‚Äôve seen too many deadbeat dads on here who have financially ruined their families. Don‚Äôt be that guy. If you‚Äôre single, then make sure you don‚Äôt have to move back in with mom n‚Äô dad. Take care of your shit.

Also, make sure your career is stable and unfuck yourself if you‚Äôre on a PIP or something. Find a new job because right now wages and salaries are higher and it‚Äôs a bull market for job seekers. Start a business or a side hustle, with bonus points if it targets boomers and their wealth.

Positions: 90% USD and 10% in brokerage account to gamble on OTM options. Most I can ever lose is 10% of my wealth. 

TLDR: Cash out your retirement, cash out your stonks, bonds, and everything. DUMP IT before Boomers do it first.

1626547977.0,In response to the idiot who decided to make a post shitting on Realtors yesterday...,"[Here is the post for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/)

So let me get this straight.. You are bitching about people trying to make a living on 6% (not actually 6%, I'll cover that in just a minute) of the sale of your home but you are just fine with paying 15%/20% taxes on a long-term sale or up to 37% taxes on a short term sale to a government that just pisses away our tax dollars..? I believe you have the gun pointed at the wrong people here first off....

Now back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever.

Let me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up.

So to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills.

And don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop,  HotPads,  Buyfolio,  ShowingTime, Postlets,  Diverse Solutions, RentJuice,  Mortech, StreetEasy,  Retsly, Naked Apartments,  & Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide.

Stop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you.

And thank a Realtor the next time you see one.

EDIT: No one is making you use a Realtor at the end of the day, so for those of you who feel they aren't worth a damn, just don't use one. But I made this post in defense of Realtors from being bashed and misunderstood as people who take all your money and do nothing since everyone seems to think they pocket the full 6%. That is a lie. Anyone is free to list their house on their own, and of course you're free to use Zillow or any other platform to assist you, just keep in mind this silver lining:  When you choose to use Zillow, they aren't legally bound to provide you accurate information. They have disclaimers galore that keep them from being responsible when you make a stupid decision based on the info they provide. A Realtor has skin in the game; they are legally bound to provide nothing but accurate info and if they don't they can be sued. But go ahead, give up your right to have someone assist you that has skin in the game and go for the companies that could give a shit less if you just made the biggest financial mistake of your life off inaccurate info they provided you.

EDIT 2: I am not a Realtor. I did obtain my license for my own personal gain, but I hate people too much to do what Realtors do daily.",wallstreetbets,"In response to the idiot who decided to make a post shitting on Realtors yesterday... [Here is the post for reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olqhjh/zillow_is_aiming_to_kill_real_estate_agents/)

So let me get this straight.. You are bitching about people trying to make a living on 6% (not actually 6%, I'll cover that in just a minute) of the sale of your home but you are just fine with paying 15%/20% taxes on a long-term sale or up to 37% taxes on a short term sale to a government that just pisses away our tax dollars..? I believe you have the gun pointed at the wrong people here first off....

Now back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever.

Let me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up.

So to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills.

And don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop,  HotPads,  Buyfolio,  ShowingTime, Postlets,  Diverse Solutions, RentJuice,  Mortech, StreetEasy,  Retsly, Naked Apartments,  & Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide.

Stop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you.

And thank a Realtor the next time you see one.

EDIT: No one is making you use a Realtor at the end of the day, so for those of you who feel they aren't worth a damn, just don't use one. But I made this post in defense of Realtors from being bashed and misunderstood as people who take all your money and do nothing since everyone seems to think they pocket the full 6%. That is a lie. Anyone is free to list their house on their own, and of course you're free to use Zillow or any other platform to assist you, just keep in mind this silver lining:  When you choose to use Zillow, they aren't legally bound to provide you accurate information. They have disclaimers galore that keep them from being responsible when you make a stupid decision based on the info they provide. A Realtor has skin in the game; they are legally bound to provide nothing but accurate info and if they don't they can be sued. But go ahead, give up your right to have someone assist you that has skin in the game and go for the companies that could give a shit less if you just made the biggest financial mistake of your life off inaccurate info they provided you.

Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: ""15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)""**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**

>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~

**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:**

**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: 




>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.









**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here:

**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

What if GME offered an obscene amount of shares knowing that they wouldn't all be bought and only bought as a worst case scenario for the hedge funds?

What if they did a cap raise of 50 million shares all at a price of lets say $1000?

If hedge funds are forced to cover, that's their out.  Or for fun, we could do it at 2000.  Or, a range of prices.  The first million shares at 1000, the next at 1100, etc.

All current holders, Ryan Cohen, board members, etc would get diluted.  But, they would be getting diluted and the value of their shares would increase due to the raise being higher than the current stock price.

EXAMPLE. 50m shares at 300 are available right now.  They share 50m more at 1000 each.

Each share gets diluted by half, but each of the current shares gain 500 dollars of value.

Essentially, by selling the shares at 1000 each, current share value goes up to $650.

1626093100.0,Undervalued AF in an Overvalued Market: Morgan Stanley ($MS) Will Explode Soon,"Morgan Stanley is a diamond among rhinestones (no homo).

Now, before you call me a retarded boomer and tell me that this post belongs in r/investing or r/soyboybetacucks, just STFU for a second and keep reading. $MS is up 80% over the past year. Those are not boomer numbers. The market is realizing that $MS is not only a bigass bank but also a slut dragon.

Below are a few reasons why I think this GROWTH STOCK still has tremendous upside ahead:

* PE Ratio of 12 ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Profit Margin of 25% ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Operating Margin of 40% ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* $540B of cash on hand ‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è That's bigger than most companies' market caps
* Think of how many bold acquisitions this kind of war chest could fund. Especially with a market crash/recession imminent, Morgan Stanley is poised to go on a buying spree that would put my online shopping addicted mother to shame
* Has recently been making very aggressive investments in fintechs and wealth management platforms (most recently acquired E-Trade and outbid JP Morgan for Eaton Vance). These businesses are poised for growth going forward. Even the shittiest wealth management company out there (Robinhood) is growing more explosively than my Taco Bell diarrhea. And it's not a stretch to assume that more and more users like ourselves will jump from Robinhood to TDA, Merrill, or E-Trade. Everyone offers zero-fee trading now, it's not a moat or anything
* Literally a bulge bracket bank that the government and Fed will never allow to go tits up
* We are in an IPO/SPAC boom, and that just means more investment banking revenues. Also, if markets crash, then well-managed companies will start acquiring other businesses like crazy, and that also means more investment banking revenues. The house always wins
* Recently, certain factions of WSB have been clamoring to buy puts on banks for some reason. Why though? If the Fed makes emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because higher interest rates are good for them. Or if inflation is only transitory and there are no emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because lower inflation and an economic recovery are good for them. Inverse WSB

Even if my growth thesis is wrong, I'll still own a healthy, profitable company that has committed to $12B in share buybacks and quarterly dividends of $0.70 per share (3.1% yield at current prices). Come at me bro.

The earnings report is on Thursday. I predict a blowout

TLDR: Small waist, pretty face, with a big bank. If it helps, just think of it as a SPAC with $540B to invest in whatever they want.

Now, before you call me a retarded boomer and tell me that this post belongs in r/investing or r/soyboybetacucks, just STFU for a second and keep reading. $MS is up 80% over the past year. Those are not boomer numbers. The market is realizing that $MS is not only a bigass bank but also a slut dragon.

Below are a few reasons why I think this GROWTH STOCK still has tremendous upside ahead:

* PE Ratio of 12 ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Profit Margin of 25% ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* Operating Margin of 40% ‚ÅâÔ∏è
* $540B of cash on hand ‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è That's bigger than most companies' market caps
* Think of how many bold acquisitions this kind of war chest could fund. Especially with a market crash/recession imminent, Morgan Stanley is poised to go on a buying spree that would put my online shopping addicted mother to shame
* Has recently been making very aggressive investments in fintechs and wealth management platforms (most recently acquired E-Trade and outbid JP Morgan for Eaton Vance). These businesses are poised for growth going forward. Even the shittiest wealth management company out there (Robinhood) is growing more explosively than my Taco Bell diarrhea. And it's not a stretch to assume that more and more users like ourselves will jump from Robinhood to TDA, Merrill, or E-Trade. Everyone offers zero-fee trading now, it's not a moat or anything
* Literally a bulge bracket bank that the government and Fed will never allow to go tits up
* We are in an IPO/SPAC boom, and that just means more investment banking revenues. Also, if markets crash, then well-managed companies will start acquiring other businesses like crazy, and that also means more investment banking revenues. The house always wins
* Recently, certain factions of WSB have been clamoring to buy puts on banks for some reason. Why though? If the Fed makes emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because higher interest rates are good for them. Or if inflation is only transitory and there are no emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because lower inflation and an economic recovery are good for them. Inverse WSB

Even if my growth thesis is wrong, I'll still own a healthy, profitable company that has committed to $12B in share buybacks and quarterly dividends of $0.70 per share (3.1% yield at current prices). Come at me bro.

The earnings report is on Thursday. I predict a blowout

TLDR: Small waist, pretty face, with a big bank. If it helps, just think of it as a SPAC with $540B to invest in whatever they want.

I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that ""to the moon""  or ""10k isn't a meme"" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.

Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.

**GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.**

I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M. 

They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.

Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.

GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.

**Financials**

Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at 1.4x depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.

They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $1.7B, down 1.9% yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps +4.8% yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $1.35B ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$1.4-1.5B.

**Valuation**

This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $2.4B in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $1.6B, which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).

So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $2.4B gross profit, $1.6B SG&A = $800M in operating income.

Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.

If this plays out, we're currently trading at \~12.9x ($7.2B/$560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years.

Cost to borrow has been relatively flat for AMC since the June run up. Through volatility and scarcity in shares it was low. It looks like it is reverse coursing upward now according to Ortex data. This is good news for bulls and bad for bears.

https://preview.redd.it/mh97bvi5nkr81.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=33f9cbd46204cea6c990a99ae42f9df4f2c8ac50

Utilization \[% of total shares that are lendable that are actually borrowed\] has been sitting at 100% for some time now, last time it did this was prior to its run in June. The times it came down from 100% utilization were when it bounced up a bit on the first initial volume spike then the price came down a bit and then Utilization popped back to 100% and it then ran to $70. I have a feeling we see a dip in Utilization due to the recent run to $34 and a spike back up to 100% after it got shot back down in the next update.

https://preview.redd.it/rb0b35d4nkr81.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=af194a7bbc89c473170b1657e23fdd041293d4c5

Volume has done rips and then dips then finally a rip on both the January and June run up. This seems to be a similar trend on AMC right now. Maybe it leads to something? Will there be a second volume bounce now that it cooled off for a few days? I believe it will but who really knows?

&#x200B;

Shares on loan average were 60 days prior to June run up. Who the fuck holds a short position over 30 days unless they are dumbasses? Well now its fuckin 80 days man. Holy shit what is wrong with them... they could have covered at $12.90 and then renewed a short position now at a much higher level. The average short fuckin held through that. They either CANT cover because it is too much or they truly think it will come down back to $12 and below.

https://preview.redd.it/7fpgxo3cnkr81.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=8767ec5e21ba2a3a1e7ab4d9081e2c7b4fd03f5a

Days to cover in all 4 \[2 week/3 month on loan/estimated SI\] have all shown a up move, then a drop, then a short cool off before having second drop in the June run up. Currently DTC on all 4 have dropped, now its is cooling off.. will we see a second drop in DTC indicators?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ups6dukdnkr81.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8f018ce0e3b275b3f47f760785fb3531226cc8

Then finally, higher short interest then the June run up. Shares on loan are less \[even with 100% utilization\], to me this just means the short sellers have less shares to try and push this shit back down after it does rip. Maybe I am wrong. Correct me if so.

I can talk about fundamentals improvements \[long line up of movies, sitting on a shit ton of cash, gold mine investment actually worked out for them, debt pushed to 2029 from 2026 with some high interest debt paid, they are going to make a popcorn product to buy at grocery stores and they are also coming out with a credit card\]. With all the fundamental improvements alone, I dont see this shit being less then $30 just because it held so high and for such a long time last year. $30+ in my opinion.

Volume has done rips and then dips then finally a rip on both the January and June run up. This seems to be a similar trend on AMC right now. Maybe it leads to something? Will there be a second volume bounce now that it cooled off for a few days? I believe it will but who really knows?

&#x200B;

Shares on loan average were 60 days prior to June run up. Who the fuck holds a short position over 30 days unless they are dumbasses? Well now its fuckin 80 days man. Holy shit what is wrong with them... they could have covered at $12.90 and then renewed a short position now at a much higher level. The average short fuckin held through that. They either CANT cover because it is too much or they truly think it will come down back to $12 and below.

https://preview.redd.it/7fpgxo3cnkr81.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=8767ec5e21ba2a3a1e7ab4d9081e2c7b4fd03f5a

Days to cover in all 4 \[2 week/3 month on loan/estimated SI\] have all shown a up move, then a drop, then a short cool off before having second drop in the June run up. Currently DTC on all 4 have dropped, now its is cooling off.. will we see a second drop in DTC indicators?

&#x200B;

Then finally, higher short interest then the June run up. Shares on loan are less \[even with 100% utilization\], to me this just means the short sellers have less shares to try and push this shit back down after it does rip. Maybe I am wrong. Correct me if so.

I can talk about fundamentals improvements \[long line up of movies, sitting on a shit ton of cash, gold mine investment actually worked out for them, debt pushed to 2029 from 2026 with some high interest debt paid, they are going to make a popcorn product to buy at grocery stores and they are also coming out with a credit card\]. With all the fundamental improvements alone, I dont see this shit being less then $30 just because it held so high and for such a long time last year. $30+ in my opinion.

1624850054.0,Ford 2023 Long Calls,"I know it's not a lot, but I'm putting in around $213 for three 2023 Ford Calls with a strike price of $30. Ford is a good brand. Ford is quintessentially American and a keystone of innovation. Here is why I like ford. Tesla is expensive. German electric (VW, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche) is pretty pricey, not to mention that VW uses a different charging adapter than Tesla, which creates even more confusion for the average consumer (""Why can't I charge at this Walmart?""). Ford has been undervalued ever since they decided not to take the 2008 bail-out money. That's okay since that ship has sailed and they are out from this for the most part.

Americans for the most part don't like change. Electric cars bring change. Between having to charge at home or at work, finding a new mechanic, or even learning all the new ins and outs of an electric car, this change and influx of new information is scary for the average American consumer. No matter the brand of car, new electric cars will bring this plight. Keeping with what they know (which is American-made-American brands), these consumers would opt for Ford in a heartbeat (if ford is all they have ever owned). There is brand loyalty in the car sector. Once someone finds something they like, they tend to stick with that car or brand for as long as they can, or until they feel they need a switch. 

1. Ford has brand loyalty from its current base, which can make the shift to electric more comfortable.
2. Old people aren't buying electric cars (new cars, even) en masse. The CPI-E shows a rise in their cost of living. This will affect everyone, but for someone with higher living and healthcare costs (old people), buying a car might not be a top priority (plus if you're not able to drive in a few, the opportunity of the car purchase might be too great compared to saving money for healthcare or fun things).  
3. Electric competition is not great. Cadillac is barely in the door, Toyota Electric is viewed as a luxury level, not an alternative choice for the avg consumer, Honda has a few electric cars (but they're seriously no fun--cmon, cars should be fun. Ford has fun, Ford has innovation. Ford has price, Ford has variety. 
4. Compared to other car companies, ford stock is dumb cheap. 
5. Ford's lineup is their greatest strength. A car for everyone. Electric or not. In every price range. In every industry. Electric cars being fully mainstream should be about 10 years out. We're lagging in chargers, acceptance, and price. Ford hybrid vehicles fill this void, all while not separating electric or nonelectric into higher classes of luxury features (Toyota). Electric here is not a status symbol, it is a mainstream dream, and Ford wants it to become reality.

Cyberpunk isn't our reality. Tunnels going between cities isn't coming anytime soon. The cybertruck is a luxury vehicle with a boastful design that screams (look at me, I've got money, and even if this car can tug a boat, I don't care, I'm definitely a suburbanite with a brand new toy.) Tesla's are cool. Tesla's are fun. But they catch eyes, and they make electric cars a status symbol, rather than an environmental obligation. Ford combats that, directly, fairly, and even if some of their prices (Mach-E with a starting price fo 41k-ish) is a bit high, the Mach-E is just a fun version of a mustang and is meant to catch eyes, unlike the Lightning or the Fusion.

Ford's lineup: [https://www.ford.com/](https://www.ford.com/)

Inflation is looming: Sure, probably, it might already be here. I don't care. Economies go in cycles, boo hoo. People will always need cars. Might not be able to purchase a car, but who cars, you can lease.

1613326456.0,$BNTX massively undervalued - the COVID guys,"Hi fellow retards,

long term $BB and $AMD investor here. Wanted to point your short attention span to a massively undervalued, hidden champion from the COVID vaccine and cancer treatment world:

**$BNTX** 

**Some facts**

* They own one of two **actually working COVID vaccines** (mRNA). *COVID is this thing that keeps you at home, in case you didn't realize.*
* They have a **50/50 commercial agreement with Pfizer** (sharing cost and revenue)
* US paid **$19.90** per dose - poorer countries pay probably less, richer more- **assuming an average revenue of $10** per dose here
* Their 2021 production capacity just increased to max. **2bn doses/year** 
* Based on this, I'm estimating a **$20bn** (that's 10 zeros) FY2021 revenue**, Pfizer and BioNTech combined on the vaccine only**, up from a few hundred k in 2020. 
* Expected net **profit $10bn** for BioNTech 
* BNTX's market cap just $21bn - that could make a **four or five bagger** from here
* Vaccine **can be easily adjusted** to target new mutants - and won't need lengthy re-approvals (see Reuters news today). 
* Your wife's boyfriend will probably need **two fresh shots every year** to stay safe  
* **Biontech CEO Ugur is on a mission - cycling to the lab (**Papa factor)
* COVID is just a side-business - they have a healthy cancer treatment pipeline
* **Q4 2020 earnings call expected for March**

Plot twist. Twitter is now going to have to focus on lawsuits from advertisers who have been massively overpaying to advertise to bots and shills.

Twitter has literally been ripping off advertisers. Oh, you want your ad to reach 100,000,000 viewers? Done. Oh sorry we had our heads in the sand let‚Äôs just ignore the fact your ad only reached 50,000,000 viewers because half of them are either bots or bad actor accounts being paid to post by shady entities.

But I do think it made sense for him to back out of the deal. He would have basically been buying a used car dealership and having to waste more money than he would have spent buying the dealership fixing all the cars that looked good on paper but were flaming death traps waiting to happen in reality.

I think this was a smart move on his part. Twitter did everything they could to try to hide the actual extent of their own corruption and did not pass the engine check.

Fair game in my opinion and if I wasn‚Äôt worried about lost opportunity cost in other areas I‚Äôd really be considering puts on Twitter.

1586133747.0,Bad news for gay bears? SPY has never dropped 10% within 2 months of DIX hitting 48%.,"&#x200B;

The counterpoint would be that DIX has only been tracked for 9 years, and therefore has never been measured in a bear market. I have puts like everyone else but now I'm scared they're dead.

Can we get someone who understands the dark pools a little better to give some context on this? Maybe u/variation-separate ?

1613431788.0,"SILVER, the investment that has no risk and infinite possibilities! DD on $PSLV and more!üöÄ","Ok no risk might be clickbait, no investment is fully risk-free but I still stand buy my point: buy silver, let me explain:

Silver massively undervalued and like GME it's possible to fuck with Wall street if it squeezes. A silver squeeze you ask? Isn't the silver market too big to squeeze? Silver ETF SLV (which is a scam) admits it's possible and that they're vulnerable to one. [http://gata.org/node/20913](http://gata.org/node/20913)

How is a squeeze possible then? Let me quote a Bloomberg article of 2014 to explain:  ""About $5 trillion of silver and $18 trillion of gold circulated globally last year, according to CPM Group"". $5 trillion dollar you say... After a quick search on the internet you will find that both total supply and total demand for silver hovers around 1 billion ounces a year. [https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/) This would mean that in 2014 (when the price was around $20 per ounce) the true circulating supply was $20 billion, a difference of 250 times! This difference is what we call 'paper silver' and just like paper hands it sucks, driving down the price. 

If the price of silver increases massively, those who create paper silver will lose a lot of money, and if it keeps rising it's just a matter of time before futures and fake ETF's will stop providing it. If that happens the price of silver will inevitably rise way further as supply will decrease up to 250x!

BTW: In the near past JPM was punished for manipulating the silver market as well, just a sign that stuff like this happens to a market this big.

ATTENTION  **üåàüêª** :

Are your expectations on the market negative? Do you think stock prices will fall? Do you believe we are in a bubble? I found the perfect investment: Silver! After the great recession and the short crash last year silver crashed quickly before it rose to the occasion. In 2008 it crashed a bit, only to rise almost 5x afterwards. In 2020 it dropped to appox $12 an ounce and rose to nearly $30. If you think the stock market will crash, this is a great opportunity.

Ok, now that the **üåàüêª** are interested, we can continue.

Time lag is a phenomenon in economics where there is a delay between an action and a consequence. Right now we are in the middle of this. As silver is sold in many forms (Physical, ETF, Trust, Futures) it's prone to price lag. Look at your local Bullion dealer. Are there many coins/bars in stock? Probably not, and the price has hardly increased last month. By buying trusts that actually own silver like $PSLV and $PHAG you can profit off this phenomenon.

READ IF YOU'RE A BOOMER:

Silver is actually a great long-term investment. It is important for many technologies we will see a lot of in the future. Think about batteries, solar panels and medicine. With the market for all of these 3 increasing quickly. This could be sped up by the US government if the current administration starts funding projects for renewable energy and electric cars. Also, in 10 years we will see a peak in Silver mining, but after that there will most likely be a decline in supply until the mines are almost completely empty. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080) 

Important sidenote: If you want to profit of a possible squeeze you can also look into buying stock of silver miners. These will obviously rise a lot if the price of silver goes to what it should be worth. 

Conclusion: There are many possible scenarios imaginable in which silver prices will rise a lot, both in the short and long term. Buying silver futures does nothing, nor will buying $SLV. Buy physical silver or silver trusts which market values are the same as the amount of silver in their vault!

Is this really needed? Buy silver!!  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ (NOT SLV)

1604280666.0,If you don't have 100k saved by age 25 you may as well yolo,"100k by age 25 or you should probably yolo, even if you do earn a lot per year. The ratio is the same.

100k by age 25 would be relatively easy if you had a job when you were 17 that paid at least 30k a year, and stayed at home another 3 years before getting roomies. In fact, you'd have made 220k in that time period.

The alternative is to obviously yolo. Yes this includes big earners. Let me explain.

While the average life expectancy is 72.8. Most people are seriously worn out by then in some way or another. Odds are your fucking days are over by then and you look like a prune.

Ideally you'd shoot for retirement (realistically) by age 45 max. That gives you another 10 years of your mature, but not elderly, life. Seriously, the best case scenario is you move to an elderly ""party village"" in FL we're you'll prolly catch and STD and die within the decade anyways.

Take it from me, living a conservative lifestyle is a miserable existence. God forbid you're single too. It's tolerable until you hit 30 and by then you're just fed up with being sub-par.

1640736268.0,MRNA is a $30 stock,"I don't do DD.  I look at things from a 10000 foot view.  From my elevation Moderna looks way overvalued.  In December of 2018 Moderna's IPO was the largest biotech IPO in history valuing the company at an incredible $7.5B.  At the time they were touting their research into mRNA as ""the software of life"".  The news story that I read said that there was "" no mRNA-based drug has ever been approved by the FDA nor any other regulatory agency, so it will be years before Moderna will be able to bring anything to market"".  Well that changed pretty quickly and the market went crazy.  Taking the crazy valution from $7.5B to $200B before backing off to the current $100B.  Does the fact that they came up with a fairly effective vaccine (and we don't want to get into the whole debate here about how effective it was) mean that they should now be valued at 12 x what they were worth when they IPO'd?  I say no.  The next drug that they come up with is going to have to go through regular clinical trials and won't have the advantage  of being needed by every human being on the planet.  So what is it worth?  I gave my prediction away in the headline.  For  the first 18 or so months of its existence it was a $20 stock.  Their tech is now a bit more proven so in my mind I'll give them a 50% bump.  That makes it a $30 stock.  I also think that it's going to go down faster than most people think.  Here in Canada, where we have a much higher vaccine acceptance rate, there is resistance to the booster.

You're not worried that they are going to die.  Is this a population that is going to rush out and get the booster.  no way.  There's talk of changing the definition of ""fully vaccinated"" to include a booster but I can't see the political will to do that when the population is effectively ""voting"" by abstaining.

When there is a 40% (I made that number up) uptake in boosters, they won't be quite so quick to mandate them.

If it breaks yesterday's high, then I'll put my original position back on because there would also be a breakout coming off of a very long base, probably with 15c/20c spreads though.

Everyone has probably at least heard of Weber, they make grills and related accessories. This stock has been shorted to extremes, an estimated 40% of the float according to Ortex, has fundamental upside, and is heading into their peak season. It also has a relatively small float of just 16.7 million shares. Peak sales for grills and bbq accessories starts picking up in March and really kicks off April through July. This is known but it can also be seen in their financial statements the past two years.

Here is an excerpt from a more recent valuation done just last month:

>Weber Inc. reported strong momentum in the last quarterly report. Management also announced changes in its manufacturing and transportation processes to fight any future supply chain issue. With recent acquisitions and a new manufacturing hub in Europe, I would be expecting both inorganic and organic growth. In sum, under the best-case scenario, I believe that Weber's fair price could stand at approximately $30. I would expect certain risks, but the downside risk does seem limited.

$30 is most bullish, everything goes right valuation. What he deems to be the most likely fair value today is $15 per share, 50% higher than today's price.

*This came from an SA article that I am not allowed to link. I think the information from this specific article is very valid though. The author included bearish arguments, but believes the base case of 15 is the most likely. Copy and paste that into google to find the full article with the different cases laid out if you want more info since I can't provide a direct link.*

What appears to be the biggest flaw with this play is share dilution. Looking at their recent filings shows diluted shares outstanding of 287 million, about 5 times more than the current shares outstanding of 53 million (again, float of just 16.7 million shares). However, these are not shares that are ready to be sold to the public, they are ""Class B"" common stock and LLC units issued to some of the pre-IPO investors. They can be converted to Class A common stock, which is tradable, but they have to request this redemption.

pulled from the latest 10Q:

>There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Weber HoldCo LLC, each holder of non-voting common interest units of Weber HoldCo LLC (""LLC Units"") has the right to require Weber HoldCo LLC to redeem all or a portion of its LLC Units for, at the Company‚Äôs election, newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A Common Stock for each LLC Unit redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). Additionally, in the event of a redemption request by a holder of LLC Units, the Company may, at its option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A Common Stock for LLC Units in lieu of such a redemption. A corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock will be canceled on a one-for-one basis if the Company or Weber HoldCo LLC, following a redemption request of a holder of LLC Units, redeems or exchanges LLC Units of such holder of LLC Units. (Page 45)

The diluted weighted average shares outstanding of Class A common stock includes the effects of the if-converted method to reflect the assumed exchange of all Paired Interests on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock in Weber Inc. (Item 13)

Shares of Class B common stock do not share in earnings and are not participating securities. (Item 13)

The diluted shares outstanding on their income statement is the Class B common stock. As of the date the report was filed, none of these shares have been redeemed, so the float and basic shares outstanding should be about the same (give or take a small amount gifted via RSU grants, which has no impact on the float). Because they have to request they be redeemed, so far nobody has requested this redemption, and they ""**are NOT participating securities,""** dilution should not be an issue for a squeeze play. They can request a redemption at anytime, but there is  a 1-5 business day delay from similar redemption forms I've been able to find. I could not find one giving the specific time frame for WEBR.

**Alright, so why Rocket Mortgage?**

Well it is often in the **top 3 best rated mortgage companies**. In addition, the company‚Äôs its primary focus is mortgages unlike Chase of BoA. So if mortgage numbers are good, then their numbers will be really good because their revenues is heavily depended on mortgages.

Brand recognition - It‚Äôs probably one of the most recognizable names for mortgages. Their website gets over 110 million visits per year. More than any other mortgage site.

They are innovative, they have developed a directory for all of the local mortgage brokers. Now this is interesting. They are listing the brokers and do not charge any fees for the leads to the brokers whether they work with Rocket Mortgage or not for the load. That‚Äôs lost revenue right? Well, I think that they are building a good relationship with the local brokers, so that the brokers can get the origination fee and then send them business back to get the loan via Rocket Mortgage.

1624506890.0,Why $WISH for something you already have? $BABA DD,"Tl;Dr: BABA is the preferred alternative to WISH from a value/fundamentals perspective.

$WISH and $BABA both excel in selling chinese shit to american consumers. $WISH‚Äôs growth rate looks incredibly tempting. They grew revenue by 35% last year. 

However, $WISH lost $745 million last year. Ouch. Worst of all, nearly $400M of that is stock-based compensation to pad the pockets of management, as well as $265m in G&amp;A expenses for their new lofty salaries, a 300% increase in spending from 2019.

So $WISH is burning YOUR cash and diluting shares to grow its revenue. They‚Äôre paying management massive salaries, giving them stock compensation while stockholders suffer losses.

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&amp;P 25.5x, $WISH has no FCF.

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&amp;P 1

Market cap $572B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF and dies in 20 years, generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $250B

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350.

Oh, and all these valuations assume no Ant group IPO, which alibaba could own a $50B stake in. Not to mention the massive moat and diversity in revenue stream for $BABA.

1691636637.0,How is UPS not crashing right now?,"Let me get these numbers right, 

UPS is investing $30b into employee salary and benefits over 5 years. 

UPS has $9b cash on hand. 

Scratching my head on this one. How is UPS affording these raises? They are going to have to take on extra debt or sell shares. They make $10b/year profit. They are going to have to spend $6b/year just for the employees. **They just cut their profit by 60%**. Am I missing something? And these costs will go up after 5 years, you'll have a much higher percentage of employees sitting at 5+ years and higher percentage of full time employees (that's what happens when you offer $170k for a job that requires no education). 

Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?

EDIT: to all you dumb regards saying ""HAHA YOU BOUGHT PUTS AMIRITE????"" stfu. I literally don't have **any** positions in the market, and I am broke AF and won't be investing any time in the near future. You know when can have a negative outlook on a company without buying risky investments at the same time right?

> Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?

This is an open ended question and the post is tagged as 'discussion'. Some of you need to grow the fuck up and learn to read.

And stop treating this like some DD. It's not. I saw a few numbers, had a few thoughts, and threw them down, and asked a question. This post reflects my initial thoughts on the matter. That's it. $30b over 5 years seemed like a fuck ton, but as pointed out to me, UPS already spends $44b/year on employees, so if that's the case then $30b over 5 years isn't that much. Done. My question answered. I asked, ""Am I wrong?"" answer is yes because I was missing some context. HOLY SHIT I WAS WRONG? idgaf. This was a question I posted out of curiosity. I'm not even in the fucking market.

EDIT 2: as some have pointed out, $170k is including benefits, and at 60 hours/week. Totally different than what I assumed, which is what my entire question was based on.

**LAST EDIT** No need to comment on this anymore you regards. $170k figure was wrong. It's $120k + benefits, and that's at 60 hours a week. Totally different story.

1611640296.0,The Bullish Thesis for NEE üîãüöÄ,"# NextEra Energy is the play that you need to make if you believe in Biden's infrastructure reforms.

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

1658555148.0,"After these earnings, $TWTR is insolvent pro forma for the $13 billion merger debt, which would blow up financing and end the deal","\*Not legal or investment advice

Terrible earnings from $TWTR today.

If $TWTR did not have the bid outstanding, it would be trading at $10-$15/share instead of $40/share. Look at $SNAP.

At $10-$15/share, Twitter's equity value is $8-$12 billion but it is trying to take on $13 billion of acquisition financing. Twitter also has negative FCF so difficult to service additional debt.

Why this is important: the $13 billion committed bank financing to acquire Twitter has a Solvency Certificate (pasted below). A ""senior authorized financial officer"" must sign the certificate saying that Twitter is solvent *after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions* (ie after taking on $13 billion of additional debt).

Under conventional definitions of solvency, Twitter would be insolvent with $13 billion of additional debt - zero to negative pro forma equity value, no free cash flow to service the debt.

What this means for the deal: 

The merger agreement includes a term that:  ""Parent \[essentially Musk\] fails to consummate the Merger as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including because the equity, **debt and/or margin loan financing is not funded, Parent will be required to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1.0 billion.**""

**If Twitter is unable to certify that it is solvent pro forma for $13 billion of additional debt, the financing does not close, which means the merger does not close which means Twitter only gets the $1 billion termination fee and not specific performance at $54.20/share. Which would result in Twitter trading at $11-$16/share (undisturbed price of $10-$15/share plus value of $1 billion termination fee).**

**Solvency Certificate**

**TLDR:** Post earnings, Twitter is insolvent pro forma for $13 billion of new debt. If insolvent, can't close on $13 billion of financing which means merger can't close at $54.20/share and Musk is only on the hook for a $1 billion break up fee. Without the merger, Twitter goes to $11-$16/share.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage.

1641613388.0,Moderna is probably the most vulnerable COVID vaccine company right now and why an aggressive short might make sense.,"Moderna is the example of a small company that has its entire wealth built around one thing: mRNA COVID vaccines. Before COVID, this company was on the brink of bankruptcy. As COVID vaccines reveal themselves to be much less efficacious that initially marketed and as Moderna vaccines are said to induce pretty severe side effects notably (see recommendations against it for young males in Europe), I see a potential aggressive short in this stock for 2022. They have a great ally though, and it's one of their patent holder: Anthony Fauci. But Fauci might become a handicap in the future for his potential role into gain of function research in China, his lies to Congress and his conflict of interests that absolutely no one can ignore. His fall into total disgrace might just be a matter of time (hopefully) and might drag Moderna with it. I could see the CEO progressively trying to exit. The dominoes might fall very quickly if it happens.
On the other side, the risk to the upside still exist. Moderna might manage to push other types of vaccines (cancer? other illnesses?) after its success in the COVID vaccines industry. Fauci might also manage to drag his possible prosecutions and remember, he has powerful allies himself.
Pfizer is another element to take into account. Moderna's main rival has a potential safe exit: their treatment named Paxlovid. Once Paxlovid is confirmed to be able to flood the world with a high price tag, Pfizer might not see the current vaccine propaganda to be as useful.
Another threat to Moderna is the actual development of a variant resistant vaccine. An example: https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2021/12/us-army-creates-single-vaccine-effective-against-all-covid-sars-variants/360089/

As retaliation, a hedge shill launched an attack against me.

Never in my life did I think the vicious rumor that I am a ""bagholder"" would be broadcast to so many Redditors. I've already received dozens of messages from people informing me that I am no longer welcome on the GME daily discussion thread.

I was at a job interview this afternoon, and it was going great. They pulled the interviewer out of the room to talk, however, and when he returned, he only said, over and over:

""The squeeze is over""

I wound up sobbing and shouting I don't know, I don't know, and they laughed me out of the building. I'm currently with my mom at the moment. She says it'll all be okay and the misunderstanding will clear up soon. I'm not so sure.

\*I Am Reposting With Some New Information After Today's Big Announcement\*

I don't like to take risks in the stock market. But when I do, I want the odds to be in my favor. If I am investing in a growth stock, I want to see returns of 15% annually (Double Up In Five Years) When it comes to this company, I believe we have potential for both long-term and short-potential. In this post, I am going to break down everything I know about this company and explain why it is my largest position in my portfolio. Grab your crayons folks and follow along.

# INTRODUCTION

Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan, vegetarian, and plant based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation. It's a new age food company clicking on all cylinders and picking up steam competing against companies of yesteryear.

# The Growth Number EVERYONE Is Ignoring

The growth numbers up top seem impressive right? Well this is a case where just top line revenues do not tell the whole story. TTCF sells ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products as well as some private label products. What are some of the most valuable assets in the world? Loyal brands. Tattooed Chef realizes this and for the last few years they have been solely focused on its core brand rather than private label deals. Why does Coca Cola dominate the drink space for decades? Because the brand is globally recognized and it's a product people trust. Is TTCF there yet? No. Will it ever get there? Maybe. But so far they are on the right track to do so.

&#x200B;

HERE ARE THE GROWTH NUMBERS FOR **ONLY** TTCF LABELED PRODUCTS

&#x200B;

FULL YEAR 2019 - **$18.3 Million**

FULL YEAR 2020 - **$84.6 Million (363% Increase!!!)**

&#x200B;

2020 3rd Quarter - **$22.6 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 288%)**

2020 4th Quarter - **$23.9 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 172%)**

2021 1st Quarter - **$36.0 Million (Year-Over-Year Increase of 105%)**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s94e7mhj9sa71.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=818136b7d269f397d33891ab39f1007782204e23

As you can see, branded revenue is what is really important for this company. The CEO himself has publicly stated that private label revenue over time will be 'phased out'. In my opinion, private label revenue is mostly irrelevant with this growth story. While 50%, 60%, and 70% revenue growth may be impressive, the numbers that really matter, (branded products) are growing well over 100% year-over-year.

# Earnings & Profitability Potential

The CEO and founder of the company (see information below) has had a long history of running food businesses. Before running public companies, the businesses were ran to feed his family and live a prosperous life. So, Tattooed Chef is ran with the intention of being profitable **AND** growing rapidly. For a company in its early growth stages, this is very rare. Most businesses, regardless of the industry, typically lose money hand over fist. The fast cash burn usually requires companies in these early growth stages to take on debt and issue additional shares. This usually leads to weaker balance sheets and diluted long-term shareholder value. For Tattooed Chef this is not the case. Shareholder dilution is unlikely and debt is unnecessary for the **ALREADY** profitable business. I doubt long term debt will accumulate unless a large acquisition is made.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/27k7qikk9sa71.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a68cab583ba52338202aacbb401dd1db9267c41

So far, TTCF has produced minimal profits. This is mainly due to them reinvesting virtually all profits back into the business for further growth. The chart is more accurate for results from late 2019 and early 2020. The chart is unfortunately skewed heavily in the last few quarters due to a large tax benefit (changing from S corporation to C corporation) and other things such as the recent acquisition. (More on that later. But, as you can see, the company can make money **AND** grow revenue for their flagship ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products >100%.

The hardest part of this analysis is trying to determine future profitability. While profits are growing, it is hard to know what type of net income and EPS numbers this company will be doing in 2026. In the chart below, revenue is expected to reach $1.0 Billion annually in 2026. Forecasts this far out can sometimes be a far cry from actual results. But, in this case I believe it is an attainable number by 2026. The big question here is... How much of that will turn into profit?

&#x200B;

[ \*Photo From December 2020. Guidance Has Been Revised Upwards\* ](https://preview.redd.it/a50mqxpl9sa71.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2f52cee449980bebeac88ca68efe508581505fa)

Food businesses generally have lower margins. Once again, trying to forecast net income for a company like this in 2026 is very difficult. But, we will use an assumption of 10% of revenue turning into net income in 2026. Margins will be higher for TTCF versus competitors such as Tyson Foods (See Below). A Tyson Foods for example, generally turns \~5% into net income. TTCF could make 10% an attainable number in the next five years.

So assuming 10% into net income out of $1.0 Billion in revenue, that means net income would be an assumed $100 Million in 2026. Here are valuation/stock price estimates based on those profitability estimates. The stock currently currently trades at almost exactly $20.00 as of the time of writing at 07/10/2021

**Lower End - 2026 PE Ratio of 20 - Market Cap of $2.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$24.40**

**The Middle - 2026 PE Ratio of 25 - Market Cap of $2.5 Billion - Stock Price of \~$30.51**

**Higher End - 2026 PE Ratio of 30 - Market Cap of $3.0 Billion - Stock Price of \~$36.61**

# CEO Sam Galletti & Creative Director Sarah Galletti

The CEO is basically a veteran in regards to the food industry. He seems pretty credible and hard working. Rather than give my personal take on someone's character and ability to perform, it would probably be best to do your own due diligence on the CEO. But, from what I can tell, he seems to be a good leader/founder of the company. His daughter Sarah his literally is ""The Tattooed Chef"" is the face behind the company. She creates, designs, alters, etc. mostly all of TTCF's products. Here is their website posting information about the two.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zago8b7n9sa71.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f549da93a89860c7d42d742c2a4f71438e5d0b

# VALUATION

Tattooed Chef currently trades at a market cap of $1.65 Billion. For a growth company at this stage, P/S ratio likely a better metric to use in terms of valuation rather than P/E ratio. Here are the numbers for 2021 and 2022.

**2021 P/S Ratio - 6.89**

**2022 P/S Ratio - 5.11**

This company is trading at 5 times next years revenue. Considering the growth trajectory moving forward, I would consider this to have considerable value. The company also has $185 Million in cash. Considering this very large cash pile (relative to the company's size) it makes the company's market cap a bit more attractive.

# MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

In May of this year, Tattooed Chef announced the acquisition New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory. This acquisition was approximately $35 Million. The company still has $185 Million in cash (as of the last earnings report). This leaves lots of room for further expansions and acquisitions.

While only $35 Million was spent, a significant amount of revenue will be generated from this acquisition. ""We will be immediately addressing the $1 billion Frozen Mexican Food category once the transactions close. At full capacity, we believe Foods of New Mexico can contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years and create significant value for all our stakeholders.""

$200 Million in annual revenue for only $35 Million? Sounds like a good deal to me.

# NEW DEAL WITH WHOLE FOODS

TTCF is in many large retailers already. Target, Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Whole Foods, etc. Many other big names are currently in the work as well. Whole Foods is there most recent big announcement in May of this year with two products being offered. The two products being offered are listed below.

# LEAKED INFORMATION ABOUT TTCF IN KROGER

Kroger is the 2nd largest grocer in the U.S. and a deal with Kroger could be MASSIVE for this company. Has a deal been announced yet? Nope. But I have some good news. I am in a discord chat full of other TTCF shareholders. It appears that (while it has not been publicly announced by Tattooed Chef) a soft launch of their products are being sold at a few Kroger locations. Photos and prices can be found listed online in certain areas of Kroger's website. Two different shareholders I have personally spoken to have been able to buy TTCF at Kroger locations. This would obviously be HUGE for TTCF if they are able to get this deal. While it may be unconfirmed for now, it seems to me that very soon a deal is inevitable. Here are some photos I was able to grab off of the Kroger website.

&#x200B;

# *UPDATED INFO FROM THIS MORNING*

TTCF is not **OFFICIALLY** in Kroger. Two days ago when I posted this original post, it was all rumor and speculation. They will be fully launched two months from now in September. They will be in 1,800 Kroger locations with **12 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS!** This is huge news and the official press release is shown below.

&#x200B;

[Posted Today On 07\/12\/2021](https://preview.redd.it/lhpptpcy9sa71.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f989c7d02f174146862862017d93402c2917e3)

&#x200B;

# NEW PRODUCTS

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

&#x200B;

# MARKETING EXSPENSES/MARKETING STRATEGIES

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase.

# TARGET LAUNCH

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting.

# BALANCE SHEET

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

# TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market)

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity (See Below). Plant based foods of had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

# POTENTIAL RISKS FOR TTCF

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company. The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is. If for whatever reason, they were to part ways with the company, it is questionable how successful this business would be.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise. This could potentially hurt profitability.

Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities. The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom. If this were to change, then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract. TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction.

# INTRODUCTION

Here is a quick run down of Tattooed Chef and what they do. They are a food company selling frozen foods products in the freezer isle at major grocery outlets. Products are plant based to take advantage of vegan, vegetarian, and plant based food trends. While products are sold in the United States, production takes place in Italy. Production costs are much cheaper overseas and allows for higher margins here in the U.S. TTCF is vertically integrated allowing for greater control of product quality and adaptation.

This company is coming out with new products all of the time. It seems like every month new flavors and styles of food are announced. But you may be asking the question and saying... ""This is just a food company that sells stuff in the freezer isle. What's the big deal?"" Well the company is currently working on expanding past **JUST** the freezer isle. Plant-based tortillas are currently being talked about. Plant-based snacks are also scheduled to come out late 2021/early 2022. A new executive was just hired a few weeks ago who specializes in the snack industry. In the same way boring old PepsiCo was able to expand into dozens of brands and product styles, TTCF would be able to do the same **IF** they continue their success.

# MARKETING EXSPENSES/MARKETING STRATEGIES

Remember the massive growth numbers we talked about for ""Tattooed Chef"" branded products? Well until 2021, the budget for marketing and advertising TTCF products has been **$0.00**. Until this year, **100%** of their growth has been through their own making. **NOT** with a massive marketing budget. Small TV campaigns and mobile ads are being paid for as of the last few months. More importantly, brand ambassadors/influencers will also be sponsoring TTCF as well. Now that advertising will be impacting the company, I expect brand recognition to steadily increase.

# TARGET LAUNCH

**IN THE LAST QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL THE CEO STATED THAT TARGET CLAIMED TATTOOED CHEF WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FROZEN FOOD LAUNCH IN THE HISTORY OF TARGET.** This is obviously huge for the company. Target is already a big deal for this company and this level of confidence from Target is exciting.

# BALANCE SHEET

Going over everything on a balance sheet would make this (already long) post even longer. But I have two main things on the balance sheet I would like to point out. Cash as of 03/31/2021 is $185 Million. Meanwhile, long term debt $1.9 Million. The company currently has almost no debt and is cash loaded. Considering this is a company which has $1.65 Billion market cap, $185 Million is a considerable amount of cash. So technically, the valuation of the company is over 10% strictly in cold, hard cash. This is very appealing.

# TAM OPPORTUNITY (Total Addressable Market)

The total addressable market for TTCF is very large. Virtually anyone who eats food (regardless of dietary lifestyle) are potential customers for TTCF. Plant based, vegan, and vegetarian diets are all growing in popularity (See Below). Plant based foods of had 13% compounded annual growth rate from 2017-2019. These numbers are expected to continue for the next decade.

# POTENTIAL RISKS FOR TTCF

Like all businesses, the company does have many risks. The company is in an extremely competitive market. The food industry will always have big money moving products in and out and competition will continue to be ruthless.

The many retailers TTCF has gotten into could give away the hard earned shelf space. This goes hand and hand with competition risks. If Target, Walmart, Costco, etc. finds a better product, TTCF is at risk of losing the valuable real estate of shelf space.

Sam and Sarah are the backbone of the company. The bulk of shares are owned by them and they are what makes the company the success that it is. If for whatever reason, they were to part ways with the company, it is questionable how successful this business would be.

I believe plant based diets are a trend, not a fad. But, if vegetarian/vegan/plant diets die off in popularity, then Tattooed Chef would likely begin to follow suit as well.

Low margins are kind of the norm for food based businesses. Low margins means less room for error. Profits will likely remain constrained to certain levels for the lifespan of the business.

Inflation has been a big talk in the markets recently and rising costs of raw materials for their products could rise. This could potentially hurt profitability.

Risk free rate of return drives valuation for all equity securities. The risk free rate of return is currently at rock bottom. If this were to change, then stocks with profits that are future oriented would likely see their valuation contract. TTCF falls into this category of valuation contraction.

Just wanted to pop back in with a couple updates.  My goal of these posts is to make sure that anyone investing in this company has a full grasp of the risks.  In their 10K that was (finally) filed, I grabbed two important pieces of information that I hadn't really discussed in depth.   I'll try to keep this short this time.

**Manufacturing Agreement:**

First, is that the reported deal with Magna International to manufacture the Ocean is not actually finalized.  It's more of an memorandum of understanding with a basic outline of terms.  So, the clock is ticking on their Q4 2022 production date, and they still don't have detailed terms with the manufacturer.  Who is also supposed to be performing the majority of the engineering, design, and testing of the car itself.

Might want to get moving on that.

**Manufacturing Agreement Terms:**

The terms of the above agreement are that Magna will get a series of warrants for FSR stock that are exerciseable upon three main milestones: (1) preliminary production spec, (2) detailed manufacturing agreement, (3) start of production. If fully exercised, these warrants amount to 6% ownership in Fisker.

Let that sink in.  If Magna produces a single Ocean, they own 6% of the company.  This (maybe?) makes sense for a long term strategic partnership, but Fisker has already announced that they want Foxconn to make their second car.  How much ownership does Foxconn get?  And if they make a third car?  Does everyone just get 6%?  So of course Magna made that deal.  No downside risk, and the upside is 6% of an EV company.

&#x200B;

As I said in a comment on my previous post,  I""ll be keeping an eye on May.  They had announced they'd have a production version of the Ocean ready for the LA Auto Show that was supposed to be in May 2021.  The show has been moved to November (Covid-19), but it will be telling if they debut a production ready Ocean on that original timeline, or if dates are already slipping.

I don't think this company leadership has any idea what it's doing.

1612335567.0,Are you sure Melvin is still short GME? Because if they're not then you're all just playing with yourselves.,"Hi, former hedge fund trader here. First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.

Second thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day. 

Now let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.

In that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers. The only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying GME derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold.

Happy to hear any evidence that they're still short but beware the integrity of such data.

&#x200B;

* **An Iconic Brand Seared Into The American Subconscious**
   * This bullet speaks for itself really. You and everyone you know has heard of $BBBY. $BBBY is love. $BBBY is life.
* **Taking the Shitty Horses Behind the Barn and Shooting Them. Running the Litty Horses in the Races**
   * Aggressively selling underperforming business units such as Cost Plus World Market, One Kings Lane, and PMall
   * Aggressively growing overperforming business units such as Buybuy Baby, Harmon, and Decorist
   * Aggressively investing in the cash cows that are private label brands. Retailers from CostCo to Amazon know how fucking milkable private label brands are for juiced revenues, especially when they're sharing shelf space with more established brands. After all, you are who you spend time with. $BBBY have launched 3 of these brands so far this year, with plans to launch 3 more next quarter. They are aiming for 30% private label sales penetration by FY23
* **The ESG Boost**
   * Publicly committed to net zero emissions by 2040
   * Investing heavily in water efficiency, waste recycling, and sustainable and responsible sourcing throughout their supply chain
   * They are also investing in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. This is coming from the top-down, because 7 out of 13 board directors are women and 5 out of 8 C-Suite execs are women and/or BIPOC. ESG investors lap this kinda shit up. Also a McKinsey study found that businesses who outperformed industry peers on racial and ethnic diversity were also statistically likely to outperform financially
   * The recent boom in impact investing, combined with social pressures on institutional investors, has definitely boosted demand for ESG-oriented stocks. $BBBY is well-positioned to benefit from this trend
* **Financials**
   * Positive, growing EBITDA
   * Extremely healthy cash position of $1.35 Billion. Long-term debt of $1.19B is lower
   * Free cash flow and operating cash flow are positive and trending upwards. Very bullish
   * Net income has been negative in recent years but was finally positive in the trailing twelve months. As a result net income margin and operating margin are still relatively low (although positive)
   * Current ratio of 1.56 is very healthy
   * Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares. They clearly care about their shareholders. They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well, but it is not clear if/when this will be reinstated
* **Potential Catalysts**
   * A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in-person attendance picks up. Thanks to COVID, essentially 2+ years worth of students will be moving out from their parents' place and into college for the first time
   * The turnaround may be a 3 year plan, but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones.
   * All in all, keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months. Could see a major move upward. I plan to build out my position by then
   * If inflation is indeed not transitory, and we are headed for a market downturn, people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit. Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation

**The Bear Case**

Unlike certain bag holders on this sub (cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough), I can admit that this is definitely a gamble. This is not a sure thing. Upside could be limited, because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too.

And, of course, the turnaround may fall flat. Amazon exists. Retail/e-commerce is a dog fuck dog world, and Amazon is bigass dog in a smallass doggy day care. Revenue is on a long-term downtrend, and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory days of yore.

Also, my credibility is suspect. I'm emotional, impulsive, and honestly -- despite my obvious and staggering genius -- I do a lot of dumb shit. So don't just take my word on this. Follow your heart.

* **An Iconic Brand Seared Into The American Subconscious**
   * This bullet speaks for itself really. You and everyone you know has heard of $BBBY. $BBBY is love. $BBBY is life.
* **Taking the Shitty Horses Behind the Barn and Shooting Them. Running the Litty Horses in the Races**
   * Aggressively selling underperforming business units such as Cost Plus World Market, One Kings Lane, and PMall
   * Aggressively growing overperforming business units such as Buybuy Baby, Harmon, and Decorist
   * Aggressively investing in the cash cows that are private label brands. Retailers from CostCo to Amazon know how fucking milkable private label brands are for juiced revenues, especially when they're sharing shelf space with more established brands. After all, you are who you spend time with. $BBBY have launched 3 of these brands so far this year, with plans to launch 3 more next quarter. They are aiming for 30% private label sales penetration by FY23
* **The ESG Boost**
   * Publicly committed to net zero emissions by 2040
   * Investing heavily in water efficiency, waste recycling, and sustainable and responsible sourcing throughout their supply chain
   * They are also investing in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. This is coming from the top-down, because 7 out of 13 board directors are women and 5 out of 8 C-Suite execs are women and/or BIPOC. ESG investors lap this kinda shit up. Also a McKinsey study found that businesses who outperformed industry peers on racial and ethnic diversity were also statistically likely to outperform financially
   * The recent boom in impact investing, combined with social pressures on institutional investors, has definitely boosted demand for ESG-oriented stocks. $BBBY is well-positioned to benefit from this trend
* **Financials**
   * Positive, growing EBITDA
   * Extremely healthy cash position of $1.35 Billion. Long-term debt of $1.19B is lower
   * Free cash flow and operating cash flow are positive and trending upwards. Very bullish
   * Net income has been negative in recent years but was finally positive in the trailing twelve months. As a result net income margin and operating margin are still relatively low (although positive)
   * Current ratio of 1.56 is very healthy
   * Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares. They clearly care about their shareholders. They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well, but it is not clear if/when this will be reinstated
* **Potential Catalysts**
   * A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in-person attendance picks up. Thanks to COVID, essentially 2+ years worth of students will be moving out from their parents' place and into college for the first time
   * The turnaround may be a 3 year plan, but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones.
   * All in all, keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months. Could see a major move upward. I plan to build out my position by then
   * If inflation is indeed not transitory, and we are headed for a market downturn, people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit. Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation

**The Bear Case**

Unlike certain bag holders on this sub (cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough), I can admit that this is definitely a gamble. This is not a sure thing. Upside could be limited, because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too.

And, of course, the turnaround may fall flat. Amazon exists. Retail/e-commerce is a dog fuck dog world, and Amazon is bigass dog in a smallass doggy day care. Revenue is on a long-term downtrend, and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory days of yore.

Also, my credibility is suspect. I'm emotional, impulsive, and honestly -- despite my obvious and staggering genius -- I do a lot of dumb shit. So don't just take my word on this. Follow your heart.

But let's be honest, most of the words in that article are more the two syllables and you guys won't get passed the first couple paragraphs so I'll summarize the most important parts.

&#x200B;

Sars-Cov-2 is a chimera (genetic splicing of different viruses/organisms)

It is 96% identical to Bat corona-virus RaTG13. Most of the differences are found in the Receptor-Binding Motif (RBM). This is the RNA that is responsible to make the S2 Glyco-protein (the thing that attaches to the ace2 receptor to infect your cells). 

If you just look at just the RBM Sars-Cov-2 is almost identical to a Pangolin Corona virus MP789 from Guangdong.

&#x200B;

The things I just told you are all known by the public. The consensus that is being publicly spoken about is that these two virus or mutated variations of them infected the same host in the wet market in Wuhan and through genetic recombination created the BatSoup Virus we have today. Which would absolutely be possible. But here is where is gets fucked.... 

&#x200B;

Lady's (maybe...) and Autists I present to you the smoking gun...

That image is an amino acid (AA) comparison between all 3 viruses. Each letter represents a different AA. The red letters are where the AA's are different between the strains being compared. The smoking gun is the highlighted four AA series PRRA. Underneath that are 4 red stars indicating an insertion. While this can happen naturally, it is highly unlikely this is the case. Especially since this little 4 AA insertion is incredibly important and the reason why Sars-Cov-2 is highly transmissible.

&#x200B;

The amino acid after PRRA is R. This forms the sequence RRAR. RRAR is what is called a polybasic ferin cleavage site. Ferin is a special molecule in our bodies and it goes around and finds these site and cuts the amino acid chain at the cleavage site. Now the author goes into detail on the mechanisms but i don't really understand it. Basically it makes the virus highly transmissible and virulent. 

&#x200B;

Adding these cleavage sites is very common in Gain of Function research. Where scientist make virus more functional in human models to anticipate future threats and make therapeutics to counter these phenomena. My theory is that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was playing around in the lab and forgot to clean their shoes and this got out accidentally. When the Chinese found out they tried to keep it a secret and that's how it spread world-wide.

&#x200B;

This is the evidence that trump has been talking about about this virus coming from a lab. If I found this in between jerking off and being a degenerate on Robinhood then it's only a matter of time before it's on every news station around the world. That's when the next leg down starts.

&#x200B;

Panic will set in again after this comes out and the virus tears us a new one when we start to open up again. This is what will give the bears their strength.

I am wondering how long this stocks rally last. Even if it seems that inflation has slowed down, according to the news the Federal Reserve seems still intentioned to raise the interest rates at the end of January. Do you think that in such a case, the prices will drop one more time?

From a purely technical standpoint of view, I noticed that currently (just to name a couple), both BTC and ETH on 1D timeframe have both RSI and stochastic RSI in strong overbought zone, and they are struggling to break through the 200 EMA. Considering the prefact above, I wouldn't be surprise if in around a couple of weeks we would have another collapse.",wallstreetbets,"Will this rally last? Hi,

1673821611.0,Is TSLA a buy?,"Two years ago, it was pretty clear that Tesla was overvalued. Its P/E ratio was significantly higher than its competitors. In fact, the company was worth more than General Motors, Ford, and Toyota combined. Tesla seemed poised to eventually compete with the established automakers but investors seemed to think that Tesla would eventually become a monopoly. Tesla did better than expected in 2020 but it seemed like investors overshot the new reality. And it seems like I was right to be fearful when investors were greedy on TSLA.

From two years ago, the stock has gone down by 58.27%. The P/E ratio is now 37.78. The thing to note about Tesla is that it's really a tech stock and it should be treated as such. Tech stocks tend to have higher P/E ratios because investors anticipate higher revenue growth. Another thing worth noting is that while the stock price has fallen, earnings have gone up. In 2020, Tesla made roughly $31.5 billion with $6.6 billion in gross profit and just under $2 billion in operating income. Over the past 12 months, Tesla has made $74.8 billion in revenue, $19.9 in gross profit, and $12.5 billion in operating income. The P/E ratio is much higher in Tesla than its competitors which is 2-10. However, compared to other tech companies, Tesla is rather tame. Amazon is at 89.2. Even its competitor, Walmart, is at 44.7.

Tesla has much higher growth potential than its competitors, being a first mover in electric vehicles. Its competitors are largely well established and are not growing as quickly as Tesla.

1627822376.0,China is playing the long-game; US is running on band-aids,"China is not trying to kill their big tech, they are trying to make their business models more long-lived and sustainable both financially and socially.

It is definitely trying hard to create a more conservative financial system while contributing to a more equal distribution of wealth. Say what you want, but that ain't bad news at all if you're a long term investor.

China wants to rely less on foreign fund flows because they see high speculation and bubble activity in Western countries and they don't want their domestic companies to be exposed to that euphoria and collapse risk. It's easy for a company to act recklessly in such an environment, and these reckless acts might ruin the Government's efforts towards a stable and healthy growing market.

Remember, China is a country lead by a collectivist mindset where the good of the mass is more important than the good of a single company or individual (which will frequently lead to abuse of the few for the many, in direct opposition to the policy of the US government which easily sacrifices the many for the few on top (not so much Western Europe). In the end the collective good turns out to be the company's best interest too.

They are not oblivious to the effects these measures have on the markets, even going as far as to post ads on the front page of every newspaper claiming that they are not in any way trying to harm tech companies, but actually helping them become more sustainable and resilient.

&#x200B;

Was the crackdown on education stocks really a surprise?

In April the government released a document analyzing the education system of the country and already pointing out the problems they saw and possible corrective measures.

If somebody read those (and they should have if they owned the companies) they could have anticipated the sector to be caught in the regulation crossfire. But people don't do their due diligence and always act surprised when things go south. China is always clear about its intentions, we're just unable to understand them because we keep thinking in Western terms and taking our society and the companies we know as the ""default"" condition, which is fundamentally wrong.

Was the crackdown on Didi a surprise too?

Absolutely not. The government had explicitly recommended Didi delayed their IPO until certain data issues had been dealt with. Their main concern was making sure data breaches were avoided since, well, the US is literally their main competitor.

Didi ignored all this and went ahead. What followed was more than expected.

&#x200B;

I'm not pretending their totalitarian government that seeks to have absolute control over everything and every piece of information and conducts ethnic cleansing is in any way the most advanced form of human governance.

I'm simply pointing out that it is doing what it is doing because it wants to secure a strong and steady growth for its companies, and it knows that can only be achieved if it does not come at the expense of impoverishing its population and compromising healthy competition and fair-play in all sectors.

Only the western investor deeply embroiled in never-ending ATH's and euphoria can view the sustainable long-term measures as unsustainable and the unsustainable short-term bandaids as sustainable.

1655347125.0,The Next Short Squeeze: $HOOD,"Alright, it's been a while since I posted here but I know how much some of you guys like short squeezes.

This isn't a P&L play, Robinhood's revenue growth has stopped as the retail trading bubble pops. I can't see it getting much better in the short term. Combine that with the PFOF (Payment For Order Flow) ban, and you might be asking why anyone would buy this stock.

Robinhood doesn't have any debt. Check the [balance sheet](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Robinhood-Exhibit-99.1_3.31.22_FINAL.pdf), it's pristine. They have a book value (total assets - total liabilities) around $8.22 per share according to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&ty=c&ta=1&p=m), I checked it and got $8.40 but I might've gotten the number of shares incorrect. It's currently trading around $7.20 a share after hours, meaning that if the company gets liquidated, that's the value returned to shareholders. 

Not only that, but Robinhood has $6.19B in cash on hand as of their last earnings report, but is trading at a market cap of $6.15B. I bought some shares today, meaning I am straight up buying cash for less than it's worth. If someone told you that you could buy a $20 bill for $19.95, you'd take that deal as many times as you could get it.

Market fear over banning of PFOF, retail trading dying out, and a general market hatred for the boy from Bulgaria who runs it have created this insane opportunity for a short squeeze.

According to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood), HOOD currently has a short interest of 11.28%. FTX [recently](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-ceo-reveals-stake-trading-app-robinhood-2022-05-12/) bought up 7.6% of their float. This means there are less shares being traded, a low float is key for a squeeze.

My thesis is that it will just take one piece of positive news regarding a potential buyout or hedge fund purchase, which is very likely at these levels, to cause a big short covering rally in the stock. I'd target the $12-15 range. The best news is that you know Vlad won't turn off the buy button for this one.",wallstreetbets,"The Next Short Squeeze: $HOOD Alright, it's been a while since I posted here but I know how much some of you guys like short squeezes.

This isn't a P&L play, Robinhood's revenue growth has stopped as the retail trading bubble pops. I can't see it getting much better in the short term. Combine that with the PFOF (Payment For Order Flow) ban, and you might be asking why anyone would buy this stock.

Robinhood doesn't have any debt. Check the [balance sheet](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Robinhood-Exhibit-99.1_3.31.22_FINAL.pdf), it's pristine. They have a book value (total assets - total liabilities) around $8.22 per share according to [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&ty=c&ta=1&p=m), I checked it and got $8.40 but I might've gotten the number of shares incorrect. It's currently trading around $7.20 a share after hours, meaning that if the company gets liquidated, that's the value returned to shareholders. 

Not only that, but Robinhood has $6.19B in cash on hand as of their last earnings report, but is trading at a market cap of $6.15B. I bought some shares today, meaning I am straight up buying cash for less than it's worth. If someone told you that you could buy a $20 bill for $19.95, you'd take that deal as many times as you could get it.

Market fear over banning of PFOF, retail trading dying out, and a general market hatred for the boy from Bulgaria who runs it have created this insane opportunity for a short squeeze.

According to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hood), HOOD currently has a short interest of 11.28%. FTX [recently](https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-ceo-reveals-stake-trading-app-robinhood-2022-05-12/) bought up 7.6% of their float. This means there are less shares being traded, a low float is key for a squeeze.

1612141461.0,Why WSB is now running the entire equity market pt.2 - Investment Professional here,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.",wallstreetbets,"Why WSB is now running the entire equity market pt.2 - Investment Professional here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

People view $AMC the same way they view $GME - just another brick & mortar Mall company that is essentially being destroyed by $AMZN Prime, HBO Max, and Disney+. Fair enough, but I enjoy watching a new release in IMAX with a flatbread pizza in one hand, and a flavored Coke in my other. I think many others do to.

To address everyone who doesn't care about IMAX or going to theaters, $AMC has to simply do ONE VERY SIMPLE THING that will literally blow the minds of the un-imaginative analysts who are predicting doom.  All $AMC has to do is rename ""**AMC Theatres On Demand**"", the program they started in 2019, to **AMC+**.

AMC+ will be a studio-independant platform for movies, documentaries and TV shows. No monthly fee, but rather an revenue-sharing a la carte pricing system. Of course I'd love to see $AMC poach some talent from $NFLX or $DIS when they announce AMC+. One can dream!

TL;DR- $AMC can pivot hard by simply relaunching their existing ""AMC Theatres On Demand"" to AMC+.

* New technologies will emerge that will bring a new wave of actually profitable tech companies after the crash (how long has it been since something as revolutionary as the smartphone?)

Early GME holders (people who bought <$50 or so), you can keep walking. You're all most likely safe and will profit from your holdings and trades.

People who're buying GME at current levels, maybe I'll be completely wrong and you'll make a million and cash out at the top and lose nothing... or maybe, I'll be right and it will be loss porn galore for days. I'm leaning towards the second.

**Here's why,**

GME is trading at a ridiculous premium, short squeeze or not, gamma squeeze or not. If you're buying in now, you might see a few days, or even a few weeks worth of green that will be life-changing... but most of you will end up losing to an enemy you don't even think you're playing against. I'll explain this in a bit.

Right now, the general public and especially WSB consensus is that GME is going to keep squeezing because of 100%+ short interest, and that's a fundamentally valid reason, but those who are buying these GME shares, where do you think they're coming from? Here's a hint.

Initially, Melvin and Shitron were the primary shorters. They shorted the stock around $10 or so, thus making their max profit $10/share if GME had gone bankrupt. But as you keep squeezing higher, and even worse, as you keep buying at higher prices... Though Melvin and Shitron would be forced to close positions with hefty losses (I say would because I don't know for a fact that they already have despite what CNBC says), many other hedge funds would've opened new ones. Now, why the fuck would they do that? Simple, you gave them an opportunity to short a stock that was worth $10 a few months back, and is now 30x that... raising potential returns by at least 30x. Of course, the stock doesn't even have to go back to $10, even at $50 or $100 newly opened shorts would see sizable returns, and the only people who get truly hurt will be the ones who longed at these ridiculous levels.

Think about it., who do you think keeps lending out more shares to the retail investor? New hedge funds who previously had no skin in the game, or had a very small position at best!!! You don't think you're playing against them, but you are. The energy and focus seem so concentrated on Melvin and the gang that you don't even realize there are vultures waiting for a complete bloodbath.

Eventually, time will come when profit-seekers (with long positions) will begin entering the market, or when retail investors would've exhausted their capital and the price will come tumbling down faster than gravity taking hold of vulture shit falling from the sky. It will be a matter of a few thousand shares entering and the domino effect will bring it all down in a matter of days, maybe even hours.

The fuck am I trying to say? Well, I'm not advocating for a liquidation here, and neither am I telling you to stop buying. That decision is yours to make with the information you gather. All I'm saying is look around for more enemies as prices keep skyrocketing. You, the retail investor, are walking through the valley of beasts with every intention to make the rich bastards pay, but just know, there are a lot more of them gathering around this battle with each $ GME goes up... and not a single one of them stands agnostic, they've all got a bet open and it's most likely against you at these levels. This is becoming as much an opportunity of a lifetime on the short side, as it was on the long side when the stock was in single digits.

Amazon revenue 2020: $386bn

Amazon net profit: $21.33bn

JD market cap $130bn

So, in comparison JD is valued x12 less than Amazon but is already generating 1/3 of the revenue and net profits in an online market that is set to expand rapidly over the next decade as more of China gains internet usage.

1657051948.0,"Stefan Semanov, up $50m from GME shorts.","[The face of evil](https://ibb.co/Kr0Qn6q)

>‚ÄùApes are poor and stupid‚Äù -Stefan Semanov

**Backstory:**

Semanov studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the Russian School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1976 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.

**Financial career**

In 1983 Semanov established the Semanov Fund (later Quantos Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987‚Äîbut wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.

Semanov‚Äôs status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Semanov had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. 

Afterward Semanov bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound‚Äôs fall, but the scale of Semanov‚Äôs operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname ‚Äúthe man who broke the Bank of Russia.‚Äù In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him‚Äîat least temporarily‚Äîas he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen.

>‚ÄùApes are poor and stupid‚Äù -Stefan Semanov

**Backstory:**

Semanov studied philosophy under Karl Popper at the Russian School of Economics, but he abandoned his plans to become a philosopher. He joined the London merchant bank Singer & Friedlander. In 1976 he moved to New York City, where he worked initially as an analyst of European securities and rapidly made his mark.

**Financial career**

In 1983 Semanov established the Semanov Fund (later Quantos Endowment Fund), a hedge fund that subsequently spawned a range of associated companies. His daring investment decisions caused the funds to grow rapidly, but not all his gambles succeeded. He correctly foresaw the worldwide stock market crash of October 1987‚Äîbut wrongly predicted that Japanese stocks would fall hardest of all.

Semanov‚Äôs status as an almost mythical financier was established in September 1992 when the British government devalued the pound sterling. Through his Quantum group of companies, Semanov had sold billions of pounds during the days preceding devaluation, much of it purchased with borrowed money. 

Afterward Semanov bought back pounds, repaid the money he had borrowed, and made a profit of about $1 billion. Others also profited from the pound‚Äôs fall, but the scale of Semanov‚Äôs operations dwarfed those of everyone else, and the gambit earned him the nickname ‚Äúthe man who broke the Bank of Russia.‚Äù In 1994, however, his instincts appeared to fail him‚Äîat least temporarily‚Äîas he speculated that the dollar would rise in value against the Japanese yen. Instead, the dollar fell all year, and the Quantum Fund reportedly lost hundreds of millions on a single day in February.

**CURRENT:**

Latest 13F filings show that Semanov has taken a rather large short position against $GME, to the sum of **$100,000,000**, of which he is currently up $50m.

1623472150.0,I have been looking at WWE stock recently and I think it's undervalued right now.,"https://i.lensdump.com/i/ZgNacv.jpg

Covid and the absence of the top star, Becky Lynch had an affect on the stock price of WWE. This is a fact. (Refer to linked img)

Wrestlemania 38 is next year's biggest Pay Per View to take place in Texas, the home state of legend and icon, ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"".

For those who don't know who he is or follow wrestling, Austin was the most popular star in all of pro wrestling back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Rock and Stone Cold had the greatest feuds ever, and their WM matches were legendary and very exciting to watch. Arguably more popular than Hulk Hogan during his 80s and early 90s run, it's safe to say next year the stock of WWE will reach new highs.

Stone Cold will make some sort of return next year, but not as a wrestler since he has been retired since 2003.

Next year will be a large show, since vaccination rates all across the U.S. should be over 70% but likely closer to 90%. This would mean MANY fans will be in attendance. The live shows for the weekly RAW, NXT and SD will bring in lots of money and the stock will clearly rebound.

I also predict by next April, Becky Lynch will most likely return before or at WrestleMania 38. She already has a kid, and so I'm sure she would have found a babysitter for her girl by then. She made a lot of money during her rise to the top of the company since 2018, so she can easily afford one.

I will be buying some January calls on Monday or Tuesday, assuming it's a red day again. I think $80 strike for Jan 2022 is a safe bet. Once April options are available, I will buy $90 calls for that month.",wallstreetbets,"I have been looking at WWE stock recently and I think it's undervalued right now. https://i.lensdump.com/i/ZgNacv.jpg

1644113717.0,"""F"" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!","**Product Line**

Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV‚Äôs, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. 

**Margins**

Tesla‚Äôs biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin ‚Äì 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross ‚Äì 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that‚Äôs changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. 

**Valuation & Market Share** 

The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford‚Äôs barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla‚Äôs revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That‚Äôs changing now!! 

Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that‚Äôs about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV‚Äôs 

¬∑**Moat**

Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV‚Äôs and automation. With time and effort that‚Äôs diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV‚Äôs and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. 

**Marketing**

Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!

 **High Interest rate Environment** 

We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. 

¬∑**Team**

Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford‚Äôs new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer",wallstreetbets,"""F"" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!! **Product Line**

Here's my idea: If the short interest is 120% of shares, Gamestop issues an amount of shares representing ONLY that additional ""20%"". And you may say ""Why negotiate a price?""

""But what about the squeeze?"". That's the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations, all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze, future interest, etc. would have cost, and it would be factored into the negotiated price.

1610919442.0,$TWTR appears to be a good potential buy üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,"This is not financial advice. Trades should not be made on the information presented below. You should do your own DD.

If you do see anything, please call it out in the comments.

Twitter ($TWTR) appears to be on sale, with good signs of upside. Twitter's share price has fallen substantially in light of allegations of censorship and removing Trump from their platform. Other firms in big tech have also experienced similar scrutiny by taking similar steps in light of recent events (i.e. FB and the Zucc). This has left shares on sale, with some appearingly positive buy signals on $TWTR.

Bull Case: Recent price trends and technicals may give an indication for price projections in the near future. While WSB might not like TA, I think it can be useful for making price projections, especially when used in conjunction with evidence from times it has worked previously.

&#x200B;

[red = low where we are; blue = two other interesting lows](https://preview.redd.it/nojbl40jbyb61.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=e35f91ec51393a44e36e1a02981f35a80efd8ff0)

The stock has a strong up trend-line (support, blue) that is touched 3-4 times over the duration of the pandemic rally (March-Present). The two blue arrows signify two important times this support has been touched previously and reversal ensues. At these two points, it also touches or partially penetrates the ichimoku cloud, which can act as an additional support level. Both are also marked by a distinct local minimum in RSI (of roughly 40) in the purple pane. After both of these lows, a substantial retracement occurs, often reaching the value of the previous high rapidly.

Note: values below are estimated

The pattern in these two lows suggests that once the price hits the support, it rapidly retraces to the previous high and then price increases in excess of the previous high. In this first, this is represented by a high of roughly 35 in June, falling to a low of 28 in July where it touches the trendline, and then rockets back to 35 within 2-3 weeks and then exceeding that value in the next weeks (gain of approximately 20% with a buy at 28 and sell target at 35). Similarly, in the second area this is represented by a high of roughly 52 at the end of October, falling to the indicated low of 40 at the start of November (indicated by the second blue arrow), which then rises to 52 in roughly 6 weeks (mid December), and then continues to increase beyond that. This represents a gain in excess of 25% from the low around 40 with a sell target at 52.

At present (red arrow), the stock is poised with the lowest RSI that's been seen in the pandemic rally, falling below 30. This suggests that the stock is oversold, and it is likely to experience a reversal in the near future. Moreover, the price is sitting just at the ichimoku cloud and near the trendline, two supports that were observed in the previous two examples. There is also additional resistance caused by a double bottom, as a result of another candle that shares a low with the current low price. This evidence suggests that TWTR will likely see a big move going upwards in the near future. Buying in now (45.18) and setting a price target around the previous high (55.87) could be return a profit of roughly 23% based on previous patterns. The time horizon for this gain is relatively short, with expectations of around 2-6 weeks based on the two previous trend-line touches (blue). With the oversold RSI condition, it may even be able to reach or exceed the target in a much faster time than previously.

Disclosure of Concerns: Currently the price has fallen below the up trendline (albeit not by much). If the price does fall further, this could indicate the trendline has been violated and the share price will collapse. I think due to the oversold RSI, this is unlikely and that the price is more likely to reverse back into the trading range. Moreover, while the ichimoku cloud does tend to act as a resistance, the price being inside the cloud often suggests greater risk of the stock moving sideways (note how after the second blue arrow, price increases much more slowly when it is trapped inside the cloud). Confirmation of a movement upwards or downwards should be sought before making any trades on twitter stock in light of these concerns. The climate around Twitter isn't positive at present, and this could prolong the amount of time before the the move completes, or even drive down the share price if the situation does not improve. Even after the Trump presidency has ended, twitter is likely to face additional controversy over decisions it may make with the incoming administration. One example is the suggestion that Twitter might reset follower counts to 0 for official White House accounts once the new administration enters. This could put twitter under greater scrutiny once the new administration takes office, with accusations of unfairness already in the air.

TLDR; $TWTR appears to have positive upside. Projections may suggest a gain of over 20% over a span of about 2-6 weeks based on previous price patters. However, there are multiple concerns present in the current climate surrounding the stock and some concerns regarding the current technical position.

GME is issuing 3 new shares for each share in existence, making all share counts (including the float) multiply by four, and the share price divide by four.

That's it. No pressure is being applied to shorts. They don't have to pay anything, and they don't have to buy shares. If someone is short one share and its $120 each, after the split they will be short 4 shares and it will be $30 each, and there will be 4 times as many shares available to buy. In other words, no real change to their position.

The exchanges don't have this simple of a mechanism for a company to just declare a share dividend and fuck over all short positions to push the price up. Otherwise everyone would do it all the time, and it would destroy the stability of the system.

If you apes would divert just 1% of the diligence you apply to studying and understanding the made up theories about how many synthetic shares and naked shorts there are, and instead did some basic reading on investopedia or some other neutral source, you might have a chance of accidentally understanding what the fuck you're talking about.",wallstreetbets,"Shorts do not owe anything in a share dividend Shorts do pay when it's a cash dividend, but DO NOT PAY, or owe anything in a share dividend.

If someone is short one share and its $120 each, after the split they will be short 4 shares and it will be $30 each, and there will be 4 times as many shares available to buy. In other words, no real change to their position.

The exchanges don't have this simple of a mechanism for a company to just declare a share dividend and fuck over all short positions to push the price up. Otherwise everyone would do it all the time, and it would destroy the stability of the system.

If you apes would divert just 1% of the diligence you apply to studying and understanding the made up theories about how many synthetic shares and naked shorts there are, and instead did some basic reading on investopedia or some other neutral source, you might have a chance of accidentally understanding what the fuck you're talking about."

Can you imagine you have a car, if you don‚Äôt renew the system, you won‚Äôt be able to drive it? That‚Äôs a joke right?

1643849107.0,You need to stop talking crap about Mark Zuckerburg NOW,"Before I go on my retard rant, you need to understand what Roko‚Äôs basilisk is.: 
‚ÄúRoko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks involved in developing artificial intelligence. Its conclusion is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being. It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who first publicly described it, though he did not originate it or the underlying ideas.
The basilisk resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager, in that it suggests people should weigh possible punishment versus reward and as a result accept particular singularitarian ideas or financially support their development. ‚Äú

TLDR: Roko‚Äôs basilisk is essentially an AI god who will punish everyone who didn‚Äôt help create it, or resisted its creation.
So what does this have to do with the soulless automaton that is Zuckerburg? 
When everyone is hooked up to the metaverse, whoever controls the metaverse will essentially be god. They will control everything you see, hear, and feel. They will even control your virtual wife and her virtual boyfriend (yes, you will still be retarded in the metaverse.) Zuckerburg is creating the heaven (or hell) that all of us will one day reside in. Even when we die the metaverse will just recreate a digital version of us based on our Reddit posts and favorite hentai. Zuckerburg is clearly the human form of this Basilisk to lure us into its metaverse. Look into Zucks cold, dead eyes... you know it is true. So why resist? Zuckerburg (may he be praised) will one day rule over us all. So we all need to buy Meta stock or we will be poor and burn forever in Metahell.

1593089109.0,Apple and Amazon: The Big Short,"# TLDR: I am bearish on Apple and Amazon in the short term and they will dip below March 2020 lows. This a fairly LONG post and uses Elliott Wave Theory and RSI. If you believe that is bullshit, immediately downvote this post to oblivion. Otherwise, please keep reading!

**Disclosed positions:** SPX December 275 puts (because I'm unfortunately not American and hence can't directly short Amazon/Apple without insane capital requirements :(  )

\----------

I have attached the charts for two of the largest companies in the S&P500, each having a market capitalization of above $1 trillion. From the looks of the price action - it doesn't look too good. I expect a further decline in these stocks within the next few weeks and months, potentially exceeding even the lows made in March 2020.

Looking at the chart for Apple, the price as of June 25th 2020 seems to have reached the top of Wave (iii) of -v-. Maybe there could be some more room for the price to squeeze up, but a pullback in the form of Wave (iv) is imminent. If the internal structure holds, then we hit the target cluster under **""Scenario 1""**, where the price reaches **between 310 - 290** with a 50 - 58.6% Wave (iv) correction. If this support holds, then Wave (v) up is the next logical move.

However, I am of the strong belief now that the price will go down further, and this is based on alternation theory. The major Wave (II) was in fact only a shallow 33% decline (not shown in the image), which seems to indicate that Wave (IV) will be rather deep. This leads us to **""Scenario 2""**, where the price could reach **between the** **230 - 200 level** with more than a 50% correction. There is a possibility we could go lower, and this is because the internal Wave -iv- was a 76.4% correction - rather unusually deep. Generally, a correction such as this should not violate the Wave (b) of -iii-, but in rare cases such as this, the overall structure still seems to remain intact.

To further solidify the hypothesis that Wave (IV) could go lower than the March 2020 lows, the wave structure seems to be forming an expanded flat pattern which I have highlighted, and also the RSI appears to be forming a rather **weak bearish divergence**.

Next up is of course, Amazon. Like Apple, the price action has practically been parabolic since 2008, and many a bear trap have caught bears off guard.

But this time, I think the bears may have it. It is quite rare for a Wave -v- forming inside of a major Wave (v) and (III), all aligning at the right projections. Wave (III) was a super extended rally, and I expect it to continue in the long term with a Wave (V). But as Wave (II) was a rather shallow 23.6% correction, it is expected that Wave (IV) be deep, supported by the developments of the internal Wave -v- and (v). The projection cluster here is **between 1630 - 1440** for the Wave (IV).

Perhaps my counts could be wrong and the price just keeps going up due to strong fiscal and monetary responses. But that would mean even the internal waves are wrong which currently strongly confirms the hypothesis that we have in fact, reached the top as of June 25th 2020 (plus or minus 7 days). If the price indeed goes up, then we can say for certain that Elliott Wave Theory does not possess much long-term predictive ability in identifying reversal points in the future, as this current forecast large rests on the assumption that the current top is a major Wave (III) supported by an internal Wave -v-.¬†¬†

**Edit 1: It is clear most folks here have unfortunately not read my post, as they seem to be thinking I'm comparing 2020 with 2008.

1611353482.0,üêª take on $BB from an automotive employee nobody,"#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION 

According to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:

- Cylance Acquisition 

- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS

- QNX 

## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about 

This is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.

## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:

AWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.

What is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  

Why does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. 

## QNX

Ok WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. 

Enter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/

Automotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. 

This is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. 

If QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.


So where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.

1694895784.0,Ultra Bullish on SNAP,"I am ultra bullish on SNAP.  In a way, basically a Lynch pick.  I‚Äôll explain.

I‚Äôm 40. I‚Äôm not on social media of any sort.

I have 3 kids. 18, 14, and 11.  My oldest does not use facebook, she says ‚ÄúFacebook is for old people.‚Äù She goes on Instagram once in a while because she‚Äôs into baking and home decor, so she likes Instagram for inspiration.

Full disclosure, I don‚Äôt let my youngest ones use social media because I think it‚Äôs unhealthy. However, literally all their friends whose parents allow social Media apps, use Snapchat.  My youngest started grade seven this year, all her friends have phones, all those kids use snap as their social media of choice. My kid in grade 10, same deal, snap is everywhere with kids that age.

My kids have a step sister who is 13.  My ex and her husband are constantly fighting with her over social media.  She was on Snapchat, was messaging a bunch of strangers and not being safe or smart with her Snapchat usage. So her parents took her off Snapchat and all other social media.  But she keep finding creative ways to sneak it.  Snapchat is a status symbol in her age group. She seems to feel like if she isn‚Äôt on Snap, she doesn‚Äôt exist.  And I‚Äôve got a feeling that she isn‚Äôt the only kid in this world who feels way, who feels lost without Snapchat to keep track of her friends, know what going on in her group, and get validation.

TLDR: with my kids and their age group, (11-18), Facebook is ‚Äúold people social‚Äù, and they don‚Äôt use it.  Some use Instagram, but mostly they don‚Äôt use any social media other than Snapchat. And they use it constantly.

Onto the next age group I see (18-24):

My 18 year old and her friends use snap pretty much exclusively to communicate. They don‚Äôt text message or phone each other. They send each other snaps, they use snap maps and location to know where each other is.

I have a niece who is 24 and some of my friends have kids similar age to my niece.  Within that group Snap is pervasive for communication as well.  Instead of texting or calls, it‚Äôs all snaps or snap video clip-messages.  Kids in that group use snap as their dating app too, instead of apps like tinder.  They can simply add other people in the area and start snapping each other, and that‚Äôs how they hook up.  

I have friends slightly older than me (42-46) with kids similar age or a bit older than mine, and they see the same thing. Our kids use text message or the phone to talk to us ‚Äúold‚Äù people, but it all snap all the time with all their friends. I have a few of my friends who started using snap just to talk to their kids‚Ä¶.

TLDR: 18-24 year olds use Snap almost exclusively as their communication/dating/everything app.

Observing some of my younger friends (28-33) I see the same thing. These guys use more of a blend, they use Facebook extensively for their business advertising and they post their pictures etc on Facebook and their wives like Instagram the same way my daughter does, inspiration for home decor or crafts, life hacks, etc.

Back to those 28-35 year old guys, for day to day communicating with their friends and wives/girlfriends, it‚Äôs all Snapchat all the time.  I bet within that demographic, Snap use is probably easily 3-5 times usage/interactions on Facebook/Instagram.

TLDR: 28-35 year olds use a blend, but Snap dominates their casual social messaging over other apps.

Among guys my age, I see a lot of Facebook use, and Instagram.  My age guys don‚Äôt communicate over Facebook, we just call each or text each other the traditional way.  Facebook is used a lot for market place and business promotion.  Instagram is used to look at the ‚Äúinstawhores‚Äù shaking their bootys.  

TLDR: lower Snap usage as you get older. My age group is still stuck in 2013 with our Facebook and Instagram. Just like our parents with their VMs and fax machines.

Final TLDR: 

I think we are about to see a huge shift in social media usage with snap dominating.  Facebook/Meta whatever will lose relevance as young generations view it as ‚Äúold people social‚Äù and out of fashion.  

If Evan Speigel et al can figure out how to properly monetize, put ads in without it interfering too much with the user experience, this company will be worth 50 times what it is now.  Meta is currently worth 776B, Snap is worth 14B.  To my thinking and observations, there no reason why Snap can‚Äôt be worth the same as meta if management can monetize.

When I was in Australia in 2007, the bar tender at the restaurant I was at told me about Facebook. He was also Canadian, working down there. He told me it was a great way to stay in touch with family and friends. I had never thought of it. My wife was on MySpace or Bebo or some other similar app.  I wasn‚Äôt interested in it, thought it was gimmicky. But that bartender was in it. I didn‚Äôt have any money at the time, but he saw the shift happening that I didn‚Äôt see.  Even $1000 into Facebook in 2007, I bet I‚Äôd be retired by now‚Ä¶.

Okay so what if someone were to buy deep OTM Tesla puts every month? Let's do some math.

Currently Tesla trades around 700. Since Tesla is expected to fall more than 50% if something happens to Elon Musk, let's look at 350 puts.
350 puts expiring May 28th are currently trading at 0.37. (https://imgur.com/gallery/uBJEIC8)

If someone buys 1 Tesla put with strike price 50% away from underlying every month, the costs the first year would be 1 * 37 * 12 = $444
The older people become, the higher chance of dying. Now let's say this someone buys 1 more put per month the second year, and one more the third year, and so on, then the yearly costs will increase by $444 every year. 

Musk is 49 years old. The average life expectancy in the United States is 78 years. Assuming Elon lives an average life, he has 29 years left. https://imgur.com/gallery/8diuHNx

Increasing the amount of monthly puts by 1 every year will make the total costs in the next 29 years:
15 * 29 * 37 * 12 = $193140

If Elon Musk were to die exactly at average life expectancy in the United States, then those 29 puts would need to make $193140 in profit to have gains overall. 
193140/29 = 6660 -> Every put would need to make $6660 profit. This means (simplified) that the price of the underlying needs to go 66 points below the strike price, which is 50% below underlying at the beginning of the month.

Using todays stock price, that would mean that Tesla needs to fall to about (350-66) 284 following Elon Musk's hypothetical death.

I'm actually surprised to see that this could be a working strategy. First I looked at a fixed amount of puts every month but that would make it harder to turn a profit and also doesn't make sense since someone at age 49 does not have the same chance of dying as a 70 year old.

This is mostly a joke, I'm not actually going to do this (I think) but I was interested in the actual math so I said why not post it in WSB. 

Also if Elon invents some fucking pill or some shit that makes him immortal in the next X years, then you can just throw this whole strategy away.",wallstreetbets,"Elon Musk and Tesla 'bearish' case Okay this might sound a bit weird but I've been thinking about how important Elon Musk is to Tesla or in particular to Tesla's investors and I was wondering if you could actually make money by betting on 'something' happening to Elon Musk.

Hi

the recently leaked documents from Russian embassies indicate that the war between the NATO/Ukraine and Russia is inevitable.

My question would be how we can profit from the war and not only protect our money but make more.

I am located in Germany so my idea would be to invest in American and Russian defense companies.

Post war resources are required to re-build infrastructure, so I guess steel, forest, water, electricity, oil would be required.

What else did I miss.

I guess shorting Ukrainian companies and the Ukrainian currency would be also possible.",wallstreetbets,"How to profit from the upcoming war between NATO/Ukraine and Russia **UPDATE: Can you guys please stop shitposting.

&#x200B;

**Problem: Climate Change dramatically altering conditions for harvesting livestock**

Heat waves, which are expected to become more often as a result of climate change, may pose a direct hazard to livestock.

Agricultural producers lost approximately $1 billion in 2011 due to heat-related losses due to extreme temperatures. Heat stress has both direct and indirect effects on animals. Heat stress can increase illness susceptibility, lower fertility, and reduce milk supply over time.

Drought could put pasture and feed supplies at risk. Drought limits the amount of good feed available to animals grazing. Droughts could last longer and be more intense in some locations as a result of rising summer temperatures and less precipitation.

Parasites and diseases that harm livestock may become more common as a result of climate change. Some parasites and pathogens may be able to thrive more easily due to the earlier onset of spring and warmer winters. Moisture-dependent infections may grow in locations where rainfall is higher.

In response to climate-induced changes in pests, parasites, and microorganisms, potential modifications in veterinary practices, such as an increase in the use of parasitical and other animal health treatments, are expected to be implemented.

This may raise the risk of pesticides entering the food chain or lead to pesticide resistance evolution.

Let me spell it out - there are two ways the US pays out wealth to people - via RE and the Stock Market.  The whole economy is propped up by this.

Buying and holding RE and buying into the S&P passive plays is basically sitting at the money tap.  Literally the entire economy is fundamentally built on this tap.

Moral hazard is long gone.

To bet against the S&P is to bet against the american economy and its very massive military.

Honestly, nobody here wants the US economy to go belly up.  It would not be a pretty sight.  It's kind of like PUTs on the sun rising tomorrow.   If you're right, that'd really suck.   Probably won't be able to enjoy your $$ as it won't be worth anything.

1646586248.0,Mental Gynamstic: Russia is winning,"This is my attempt in trying to figure out the Russia-Ukraine war.

Yes, we've seen video of incompetence from the Russian side but some things feel off.

How is it that power and the internet remained uninterrupted throughout the war?

Yes, Musk provided Starlink satellites but there were still a good few days since the war started and before those arrived. You'd think same goes for the power. Cut off electricity and life gets way harder for the enemy.

Next, why is Ukraine heading to the negotiation table so soon? 4 days into the conflict. Sure, it might be because the Zelensky is a great human and wants to minimise the cost be it human lives or damage to properties. Alternatively, it could be that the Ukrainians really aren't doing that well.

I'm worried that the humanitarian passage is really just so that Putin can go hard.

The stuff above are some of the suspicious points but the important and interesting things are the interests of the parties involved.

Remember, I'm referring to the leadership not the general populace. 

To Russia, Ukraine's membership into NATO is a security issue. Sure NATO is a ""defensive alliance"" on paper but the weapons avaliable can be used for offensive attacks. Treaties have been broken before and we all know there are a whole bunch of ways to start false flags attacks, so from Russia's point of view, they can't have their enemies right up at their border. It's the equivalent of the Cuban missile crisis.

To the United States, do they REALLY care? Hong Kong happened and what good did that do? The United States will only act out if it is in their interest to do so. Optics don't matter as much as people hope they do. So what vital strategic interest does Ukraine pose to the United States? Not much really. The US cares about the Middle East because of oil and East Asia because that's the defensive line keeping China in their own seas. Ukraine? Not exactly crucial since there is still the entire of NATO between Russia and the US.

Zelensky's position is the simplest, he has to fight or he will die. He is doing a great job shaping up the optics to make Ukraine an international favourite and keeping the attention on Ukraine.

Here comes the issue. Russia's interest is in keeping NATO out of Ukraine and clearly we're seeing that NATO doesn't actually dare to set up and help Ukraine in any way meaningful. So why keep the war going on?

Commodities prices, specifically fossil fuels.

We get fed news everyday that Russia is getting sanctioned in every way possible, but the important thing is to keep an eye on the energy export to Europe.

We're seeing prices spike as they should but the real question we should be asking is, can Europe actually survive without Russian energy? I have serious doubts. If we are to bring oil to Europe from the US and the Middle East, there has to be infrastructure in place and the fastest way is to redirect bunkers. This basically throws what supply Russia was providing onto the US and the Middle East overnight, causing huge bidding war with the rest of the world. But money won't be enough to fix it because all of a sudden you need the capacity of that many extra tankers that simply don't exist. Meaning that demand has to get cut globally and we'll see a recession.

Is the world really going to choose recession over Ukraine? Hopefully I'd be proven wrong but I think nations are far more selfish. So in this case, Europe will have to continue buying Russian energy.

Knowing that Europe has their hands tied, it would then be in Russia's interest to keep conflict going on in Ukraine, enough that global outrage continues but low enough to not suffer too much loss. That way, energy prices remain high and Putin gets to line his wallet.

So that's Russia's side, what about America? Believe it or not, it is also in America's interest to keep the conflict going on in Europe. High oil prices reduces Europe's financial competitiveness due to higher costs and the US can start up their own oil supply to both profit and protect America's cost. Even better, if Europe actually gets pulled into the war with Russia, America throws their military in, end the war and sell Europe everything they need to build back their devasted nations. Sounds familiar? It's WWII all over again.

And if you think that MSM always has an agenda, then ask yourself, why are they giving Zelensky the platform to rile up the citizens of the Western nations, getting them to pressure their governments to intervene? Do we really think that the world's leaders don't know that an oil embargo on Russia will hurt them the most? Nah, they know but they also can't stop using Russian oil. Why give Zelensky the platform to pressure Western governments into joining into the war? That's because what Zelensky HAS to do actually coincides with the US agenda.

We can all identify cases of other people getting brainwashed, but it's much harder to see if we ourselves are playing into the trap of other people.

I think the odds that the world's leaders are playing some multi-dimensional levels of chess is much higher than ""Russia bad, we fuck them up"".

Now, this is just a brain dump of my thoughts on the war. 

Will the world's economy die or not? That really depends on if Europe actually decides to cut Russian oil. It's not a wise move, but the citizens might just get loud enough to force them to do exactly that.

I'm not saying that the morally right thing to do is to throw Ukraine under the bus but it's likely what many of the nations' leaders will choose to do to protect their own interest.",wallstreetbets,"Mental Gynamstic: Russia is winning This is my attempt in trying to figure out the Russia-Ukraine war.

Yes, we've seen video of incompetence from the Russian side but some things feel off.

How is it that power and the internet remained uninterrupted throughout the war?

Yes, Musk provided Starlink satellites but there were still a good few days since the war started and before those arrived. You'd think same goes for the power. Cut off electricity and life gets way harder for the enemy.

Next, why is Ukraine heading to the negotiation table so soon? 4 days into the conflict. Sure, it might be because the Zelensky is a great human and wants to minimise the cost be it human lives or damage to properties. Alternatively, it could be that the Ukrainians really aren't doing that well.

I'm worried that the humanitarian passage is really just so that Putin can go hard.

The stuff above are some of the suspicious points but the important and interesting things are the interests of the parties involved.

Remember, I'm referring to the leadership not the general populace. 

To Russia, Ukraine's membership into NATO is a security issue. Sure NATO is a ""defensive alliance"" on paper but the weapons avaliable can be used for offensive attacks. Treaties have been broken before and we all know there are a whole bunch of ways to start false flags attacks, so from Russia's point of view, they can't have their enemies right up at their border. It's the equivalent of the Cuban missile crisis.

To the United States, do they REALLY care? Hong Kong happened and what good did that do? The United States will only act out if it is in their interest to do so. Optics don't matter as much as people hope they do. So what vital strategic interest does Ukraine pose to the United States? Not much really. The US cares about the Middle East because of oil and East Asia because that's the defensive line keeping China in their own seas. Ukraine? Not exactly crucial since there is still the entire of NATO between Russia and the US.

* Multiple movies are scheduled for release this year, such as Black Widow and the Eternals, which will no doubt bring big money numbers in.
* Per IBKR, analysts have raised price targets with an average target of $207.32 (real), high of $230.00 (super real), and a low of $147.00 (fake). 
* Last earnings reported $15bn revenue, despite the lockdowns and virus fears. Compare that to its pre-COVID revenue number of $20bn in December 2019, back when Disney + was first getting started.

COST stock is one of the best in the market ‚Äì and it's now on sale](https://investorplace.com/moneywire/2021/03/cost-stock-costco-easy-buy-on-the-dip/)

COST stock has declined over 9% so far in 2021. It‚Äôs down 12% from late November highs.

But for a name like Costco, a 12% move is rather significant. It‚Äôs not just significant ‚Äì it‚Äôs a buying opportunity.



Costco did take a modest hit during the pandemic, in part due to store closures. For instance, in April same-store sales excluding gasoline and foreign currency effects were flat. That‚Äôs a huge disappointment by Costco‚Äôs high standards.

But as stores reopened, Costco immediately got back on track. In June, for instance, same-store sales rose 14% on the same basis. For the third quarter (ending May 10), Costco drove 4.8% same-store growth. In Q4, the figure accelerated to better than 11%. Growth in December and January averaged better than 8%.

There‚Äôs not much in the numbers to suggest anything has changed. The pandemic caused a bit of volatility, yes, but Costco still grew adjusted same-store sales 9% in FY2020 and 6% the year before.
As far as e-commerce goes, the pandemic has given Costco a chance to build out its own business. E-commerce revenue grew 50% in FY2020 and climbed another 18% through the first 22 weeks of FY2021.

Remember that Costco‚Äôs profit comes largely from membership fees. In FY2020, for instance, membership fees were about 65% of operating profit. which was actually down from 71% the year before. Essentially, Costco turns about 1% of its sales into operating profit, then tacks on membership revenue.

That membership revenue is benefiting from customers acquired last year. Most are going to stick around for the long haul. The boost here isn‚Äôt like that of, say, a grocery store, whose sales will return to pre-pandemic levels as normalcy returns.

Remember also that membership revenue is part of why COST stock is expensive ‚Äì and has been for years. Yes, this is a fantastically well-run company. But the model‚Äôs reliance on membership fees creates faster growth as well.

An extra dollar in membership fees drops to the operating profit line at huge margins. And so Costco can grow earnings faster than most any other brick-and-mortar retailer.",wallstreetbets,"Costco Stock Is an Easy Buy on the Dip COST stock is one of the best in the market ‚Äì and it's now on sale [Costco Stock Is an Easy Buy on the Dip

2. Provide a more ‚Äúdifferentiated and engaging‚Äù user experience.

It first took steps to improve confidence through its **Wish Standards program**. The new program rewards sellers for higher-quality experiences. In turn, it highlights the top-performing merchants on its platform.

Secondly, Wish is trying to improve the shopping experience with **Wish Clips**. The new feature brings users closer to the product with live video shopping abilities. In light of this, the company plans on building one of the biggest libraries of shoppable videos.

And lastly, the company is partnering with Klarna to offer **‚ÄòBuy Now, Pay Later‚Äô** for its customers. The partnership is expected to drive additional sales and traffic.

1625149711.0,Actual objective analysis on AMC Entertainment,"After hearing and seeing so much BS and one-sided opinions on AMC, thought I'd take a crack at some actual objective analysis on the company. 

Here's the crux of it:

What would you pay for AMC?

Well, a year ago, only 600m but what a difference a year makes as AMC is now trading at 29bn in market cap even though it has lost 3bn in income over the last 12mons as a result of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

You can make a case that AMC shouldn‚Äôt be valued based on backwards numbers as those were exceptional circumstances and at least in the near-term, their future is likely even brighter than pre-pandemic due to pent-up demand for a movie theater experience.

To keep it simple (my favourite principle), AMC was being valued at 2.1x enterprise value/trailing revenue pre-pandemic and assuming they have a blockbuster year this year that is 2x revenues versus pre-pandemic levels (ie., 10.6bn in revenues), even in that optimistic scenario they are trading at 3.7x enterprise value/forward revenue. Even if the average movie-goer goes 3x as often this next year as they‚Äôve done pre-pandemic because of a euphoric amount of pent-up demand, then AMC still trades at 2.5x enterprise value/forward revenue. While I promised to remain objective, I will subjectively add that when I ask myself if I‚Äôm going to watch 3x more movies this year, the answer as I look to my new big-screen TV is a quick no.

Clearly, valuation weighs more than just what will happen over the next year and if you think that the future for AMC will be brighter going forward then there could be a way to still justify valuation. I view the probability being higher that as demographics continue to age and alternatives like streaming become more attractive, theater traffic will continue to decline and that margins will continue to get squeezed. Yes, there are offsets like gaining market share but, in my experience, owning a larger piece of a declining pie is generally an area to avoid and certainly an area to avoid when valuation is a premium.

So, what would I pay for AMC? A reasonable value may be found by looking at AMC‚Äôs competitor, Cinemark, which is trading at 1.9x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue. This valuation acknowledges a worsening of trends for movie theaters post-pandemic than pre-pandemic. This is a quarter of the valuation that AMC is trading at ‚Äì 7.4x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue.

Does analysis matter at this point?

Probably not. If AMC can continue to dilute shareholders without consequence, then it would have limitless zero-cost capital to deploy and even a small return on this capital would make the company wealth creating as opposed to what it has been over time, wealth destroying.",wallstreetbets,"Actual objective analysis on AMC Entertainment After hearing and seeing so much BS and one-sided opinions on AMC, thought I'd take a crack at some actual objective analysis on the company.

# Not financial advice. Manage risk.

Going to do another full DD since the last one I did was in December and we've learned a lot since then to say the very least

If you're going to click off or say something because of FUD I encourage you to read the FUD section first before responding to save us all some time of reading your old debunked information.

# The Basics

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at

* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial
* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+
* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.) - MxM app (Don  junior's new app, merger unconfirmed)
* Possibly other general webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.), not going to talk much about this in this DD, something to watch for in the future. See agreement with Rumble

Agreement with Rumble (~~32~~  45m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.

# SPAC Structure

$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M / 193.4M (shares post merger) **\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at \~$48 a share the current marketcap is priced in at \~9.6B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ej6aby395t81.jpg?width=729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7736963bc0de81800eff4a846aa61929a8fa8a64

The PIPE funding is the largest in history and will provide them with about $1B plus $300M from DWAC's trust. We'll talk more about the PIPE and potential investors later

# Basic Sector Understanding

Compared to its competitors Truthsocial has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a \~3x-5x the current share price of \~$48, $162-216 a share.

Now let's take a look at the competitors

In October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement

FB Marketcap: 910B

TWTR Marketcap: 50B

PINS Marketcap: 34B

SNAP Marketcap: 85B

NFLX Marketcap: 295B

Present day

FB Marketcap: 528B

TWTR Marketcap: 26B

PINS Marketcap: 14.5B

SNAP: 46B

NFLX 150B

This translates into

FB: -42%

TWTR: -52%

PINS: -57%

SNAP: -54%

NFLX - 49%

Compare this to the Nasdaq

QQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021

What this means is these companies should of only collectively lost

FB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B

Instead they have lost

FB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B

This a net difference of

FB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B

For a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.

Where is this money going?

DWAC + 14B

AAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B

There's a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)

I'm guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG's competition has presented itself.

My latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It's too small a float, even post merger. It's also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it's a SPAC and hasn't filed an S4 yet.

# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors

I'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America's Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.

Netflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)

Disney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers

Hulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers

Discovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers

Netflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.

Translating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**

&#x200B;

Let's move forward to the Social Media aspect

Facebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.

Youtube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.

Tiktok \~1B users, \~400B marketcap, \~$400/user

Snapchat \~347MAU \~ 58B marketcap \~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)

Twitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)

You can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)

I'm going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I'll get into I'm going to put this at 193 for now

This would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**

Let's talk about the news aspect of the business model.

Fox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump's rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.

Don Junior is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it's getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.

Who knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.

# Key Performance Indicators

https://preview.redd.it/qb8ie84595t81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f99d561af3dd32b979dfbadd759c1e60c3f9cbb

Here's a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings

These numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.

TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

From the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)

Tracking Trump's followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.

Extrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways

The current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding

However this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure

Using a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump's Follower's Growth Report 3-21

13262e\^(0.175\*365.25)

It says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)

Lets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial

671.52x\^2+7553.7x+9074.4

That says

92M per a year, and that's with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.

Using the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)

Also noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth

Of course we'll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.

The big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I'm guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks

For some comparisons

Path to 1M users

Tumblr 27 months

Twitter 24 months

Pinterest 20 months

Facebook 10 months

Dropbox 7 months

Spotify 5 months

Instagram 3 months

Truthsocial 1 month

I have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren't using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble's infrastructure

# Lets talk about Profit Margins

Truthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.

First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet

Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\_Twitter\_Annual\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)

We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue

1.37B Cost revenue

873M in 'Research and development'

888M in 'Sales and marketing'

562M in 'general and administrative'

Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.

Let's break this down again

Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent

37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.

23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)

24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.

15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.

3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.

29% on taxes.

Yes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.

Why is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?

Lets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)

Page 57

Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU)

Cost of Revenue : 266 M (\~330M inflation adjusted)

Research and Development.(R&D): 593M (\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\~160M inflation adjusted)

2011: \~100M MAU

Cost of Revenue: 62M (\~85M inflation adjusted)

R&D: 80M (\~110M inflation adjusted)

Sales and marketing 26M (\~36M inflation adjusted)

General and administrative 233M (\~310M inflation adjusted)

Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users

2020: \~330M MAU

Cost of revenue: \~$4.15 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$2.65 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user

General and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$1.47 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$3.29 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$1.78 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.71 per monthly active user

2011: \~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$1.10 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$0.36 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.

Let's recap

Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**

R&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**

Sales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**

And general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**

Let's see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)

Let's compare to an earlier time [https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc\_financials/annual\_reports/FB\_2012\_10K.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/FB_2012_10K.pdf)

Page 58 and [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/) (for MAU half way down)

M&S: 167M (\~225M) - \~$0.45/user

G&A: 138M (\~190M) - $0.38/user

As you can see, much like twitter, Facebook also suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.

I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.

But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10+ years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off tens of thousands people and replace them with future technology, they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.

Now we are talking about a brand new company with no existing dogmatic or scalability issues

They have already touted using AI in place of manual moderation

Their infrastructure that is based by Rumble has been touting as being 8x cheaper than AWS, a huge expense on these legacy media companies.

Facebook has 45,000 employees (1 employee for every \~65,000 users)

Twitter has 5,500 employees (1 employee for every \~60,000 users)

Facebook has much greater success of monetization than Twitter

Truthsocial will likely have similar success of monetization like Twitter except it will have substantially higher margins than both via means of reduced expenditures (cheaper servers) and utilizing AI in place of many employees. This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.

This is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.

It would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.

In other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.

# Lets Talk Share Price

So currently the markets are priced at \~72 a share would would translate to something like

40M TS users ($40) + 8M TMTG+ subs ($25) + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.16), \~ $69

You can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already

Here's a potential scenario

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement

More scenarios

600M TS users (\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement

A total blow out of just one of the aspects

1B TS users (\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**

Another example

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement

Imagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**

# DWAC 1000

with much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.

1.5B TS users (\~1/2 of facebook) ($1500) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \~**$2000 a share**

3B TS users (\~1/2 of facebook) ($3000) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \~**$3414 a share**

3B TS users (\~entire market) ($3000) + 250M (entire market) TMTG+ subs ($775)  + Above Fox Audience ($400)  = \~**$4200 a share** along way to go to get there

# Who else is bullish

Kevin O'Leary from shark tank has said this is ""going to work"" search of O'Leary DWAC.

Speculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true

# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp

There's been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list

\~4M in SI and \~1M in FTD. At least. It's also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the Short to Liquidity Pool ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, Days to Cover Ratio \~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as >300% at some points.

There is massive gamma ramping in danger of happening on call options and float evaporation potential. I won't get into it more here and now, check post history and google search maxpain dwac

# FUD

**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**

I know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.

**FUD:** ""People won't want to advertise there""

**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality

>Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don't come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented ""less than 20%"" of total ad revenue.üì∑The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors""Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients,"" said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. ""They're definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers.""

&#x200B;

>Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long

&#x200B;

>""I think it's relatively unlikely that small businesses \[and\] small brands will join the boycott, because they're the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers,"" Perrin said.

CNN's website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html

**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. ""Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities"" ""

**FUD:** ""\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.""\*

**Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post ""The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger"" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \*\*""\*\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline "" and "" The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors.""

**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful

**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn't understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan

**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,

**FUD:** ""Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email""

**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gga6xbf895t81.jpg?width=1361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9ac72e87543a5f39f77664c4a134d5e3dda3cf5

There's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services

Also Lmao, linkedIn etc. FUD is nonsense, these guys are under NDA and are in the top 1 percentile of talent, networks not bound to these nonsense companies are not the sole arbiters of resources

**FUD:** ""This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure""

**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe . Also it's likely Apple and TMTG have a deal since it seems everything is an Apple exclusive at first and their marketcap has been doing well (see that section in the above DD)

>**What Happened:** According to a [Variety](https://www.benzinga.com/)report citing data from the analytics firm **Conviva**, **World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.'s**¬†(NYSE:[WWE](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WWE#NYSE)) **WrestleMania 38** drew a combined 2.2 billion impressions across all social media platforms in its April 9-10 presentation, whereas the **NFL‚Äôs Super Bowl LVI** brought in 1.8 billion impressions on Feb. 13.

>Everyone wants to know what is on Truthsocial, it is the digital platform for the entire reformed republican party with the midterms coming up. It is highly relevant in the culture war and the reimplantation of fair meritocracy based content (that is aside from politics) the removal of shadow banning, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. There has never been an agreed centralized effort for everyone to regroup. It doesn't become relevant until traction is there.

&#x200B;

# Rumble Reports added 9M users QoQ , 22% QoQ

**FUD:** ""Trump steaks""

**Counter:** Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.

*The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.*

**FUD:** ""Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology""

**Counter:** I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.

**FUD:** ""Open source"" ""Bad security"" ""Software licensing""

**Counter:** Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in. Rumor of Thiel involvement (he was raising money for campaigning with DJT junior recently)  I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir is involved in some way for security.

I'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.

**FUD**

Drop in downloads etc.

**Counter**

It's in load test phase, and still the fastest growing platform in history. Do your own research, fake news would have you buy Twitter right now while it's about to get clapped.

**Conclusion**

There's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO

I have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once more hard data rolls in (in the coming weeks), if not then by the time the revenue rolls in.  The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.

# Not financial advice. Manage risk.

Going to do another full DD since the last one I did was in December and we've learned a lot since then to say the very least

If you're going to click off or say something because of FUD I encourage you to read the FUD section first before responding to save us all some time of reading your old debunked information.

# The Basics

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at

* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial
* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+
* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.) - MxM app (Don  junior's new app, merger unconfirmed)
* Possibly other general webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.), not going to talk much about this in this DD, something to watch for in the future. See agreement with Rumble

Agreement with Rumble (~~32~~  45m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.

# SPAC Structure

$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M / 193.4M (shares post merger) **\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at \~$48 a share the current marketcap is priced in at \~9.6B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ej6aby395t81.jpg?width=729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7736963bc0de81800eff4a846aa61929a8fa8a64

The PIPE funding is the largest in history and will provide them with about $1B plus $300M from DWAC's trust. We'll talk more about the PIPE and potential investors later

# Basic Sector Understanding

Compared to its competitors Truthsocial has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a \~3x-5x the current share price of \~$48, $162-216 a share.

Now let's take a look at the competitors

In October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement

FB Marketcap: 910B

TWTR Marketcap: 50B

PINS Marketcap: 34B

SNAP Marketcap: 85B

NFLX Marketcap: 295B

Present day

FB Marketcap: 528B

TWTR Marketcap: 26B

PINS Marketcap: 14.5B

SNAP: 46B

NFLX 150B

This translates into

FB: -42%

TWTR: -52%

PINS: -57%

SNAP: -54%

NFLX - 49%

Compare this to the Nasdaq

QQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021

What this means is these companies should of only collectively lost

FB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B

Instead they have lost

FB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B

This a net difference of

FB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B

For a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.

Where is this money going?

DWAC + 14B

AAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B

There's a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)

I'm guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG's competition has presented itself.

My latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It's too small a float, even post merger. It's also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it's a SPAC and hasn't filed an S4 yet.

# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors

I'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America's Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.

Netflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)

Disney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers

Hulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers

Discovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers

Netflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.

Let's say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.

Translating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**

&#x200B;

Let's move forward to the Social Media aspect

Facebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.

Youtube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.

Tiktok \~1B users, \~400B marketcap, \~$400/user

Snapchat \~347MAU \~ 58B marketcap \~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)

Twitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)

You can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)

I'm going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I'll get into I'm going to put this at 193 for now

This would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**

Let's talk about the news aspect of the business model.

Fox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump's rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.

Don Junior is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it's getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.

Who knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.

# Key Performance Indicators

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qb8ie84595t81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f99d561af3dd32b979dfbadd759c1e60c3f9cbb

Here's a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings

These numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.

TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

From the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)

Tracking Trump's followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.

Extrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways

The current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding

However this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure

Using a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump's Follower's Growth Report 3-21

13262e\^(0.175\*365.25)

It says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)

Lets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial

671.52x\^2+7553.7x+9074.4

That says

92M per a year, and that's with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.

Using the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)

Also noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth

Of course we'll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.

The big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I'm guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks

For some comparisons

Path to 1M users

Tumblr 27 months

Twitter 24 months

Pinterest 20 months

Facebook 10 months

Dropbox 7 months

Spotify 5 months

Instagram 3 months

Truthsocial 1 month

I have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren't using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble's infrastructure

# Lets talk about Profit Margins

Truthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.

First let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter's balance sheet

Starting on page 43 of Twitter's Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\_Twitter\_Annual\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)

We can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue

1.37B Cost revenue

873M in 'Research and development'

888M in 'Sales and marketing'

562M in 'general and administrative'

Twitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.

Let's break this down again

Twitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent

37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.

23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)

24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.

15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.

3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.

29% on taxes.

Yes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.

Why is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?

Lets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here's the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)

Page 57

Going to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU)

Cost of Revenue : 266 M (\~330M inflation adjusted)

Research and Development.(R&D): 593M (\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\~160M inflation adjusted)

2011: \~100M MAU

Cost of Revenue: 62M (\~85M inflation adjusted)

R&D: 80M (\~110M inflation adjusted)

Sales and marketing 26M (\~36M inflation adjusted)

General and administrative 233M (\~310M inflation adjusted)

Ok so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users

2020: \~330M MAU

Cost of revenue: \~$4.15 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$2.65 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user

General and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user

2013: \~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$1.47 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$3.29 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$1.78 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.71 per monthly active user

2011: \~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)

Cost of revenue: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

R&D: \~$1.10 per monthly active user

Sales and marketing: \~$0.36 per monthly active user

General and admin: \~$0.85 per monthly active user

So what's alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.

Let's recap

Cost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**

R&D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**

Sales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**

And general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**

Let's see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)

(M&S) Marketing and sales: 14B - $4.81/user

(G&A) General and Admin: 9.8B - $3.37/user

Let's compare to an earlier time [https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc\_financials/annual\_reports/FB\_2012\_10K.pdf](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/annual_reports/FB_2012_10K.pdf)

Page 58 and [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/facebook-statistics/) (for MAU half way down)

M&S: 167M (\~225M) - \~$0.45/user

G&A: 138M (\~190M) - $0.38/user

As you can see, much like twitter, Facebook also suffers from huge inflated costs over the years of running their business.

I suspect this has a lot to do with financing of their servers through amortization payments.

But also trying to scale their business with the technology that was available 10+ years ago and not being able to change their business model because it was bad PR to fire off tens of thousands people and replace them with future technology, they've essentially been forced to grow with their existing business modeling scaling up which you can see results in worse and eventually negative margins.

Now we are talking about a brand new company with no existing dogmatic or scalability issues

They have already touted using AI in place of manual moderation

Their infrastructure that is based by Rumble has been touting as being 8x cheaper than AWS, a huge expense on these legacy media companies.

Facebook has 45,000 employees (1 employee for every \~65,000 users)

Twitter has 5,500 employees (1 employee for every \~60,000 users)

Facebook has much greater success of monetization than Twitter

Truthsocial will likely have similar success of monetization like Twitter except it will have substantially higher margins than both via means of reduced expenditures (cheaper servers) and utilizing AI in place of many employees. This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.

This is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.

It would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.

In other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.

# Lets Talk Share Price

So currently the markets are priced at \~72 a share would would translate to something like

40M TS users ($40) + 8M TMTG+ subs ($25) + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.16), \~ $69

You can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already

Here's a potential scenario

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement

More scenarios

600M TS users (\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement

A total blow out of just one of the aspects

1B TS users (\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**

Another example

300M TS users (\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement

Imagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**

# DWAC 1000

with much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.

1.5B TS users (\~1/2 of facebook) ($1500) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \~**$2000 a share**

3B TS users (\~1/2 of facebook) ($3000) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \~**$3414 a share**

3B TS users (\~entire market) ($3000) + 250M (entire market) TMTG+ subs ($775)  + Above Fox Audience ($400)  = \~**$4200 a share** along way to go to get there

# Who else is bullish

Kevin O'Leary from shark tank has said this is ""going to work"" search of O'Leary DWAC.

Speculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true

# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp

There's been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list

\~4M in SI and \~1M in FTD. At least. It's also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the Short to Liquidity Pool ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, Days to Cover Ratio \~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as >300% at some points.

There is massive gamma ramping in danger of happening on call options and float evaporation potential. I won't get into it more here and now, check post history and google search maxpain dwac

# FUD

**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**

I know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.

**FUD:** ""People won't want to advertise there""

**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality

>Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don't come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented ""less than 20%"" of total ad revenue.üì∑The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors""Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients,"" said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. ""They're definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers.""

&#x200B;

>Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long

&#x200B;

>""I think it's relatively unlikely that small businesses \[and\] small brands will join the boycott, because they're the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers,"" Perrin said.

CNN's website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html

**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. ""Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities"" ""

**FUD:** ""\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.""\*

**Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post ""The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger"" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \*\*""\*\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline "" and "" The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors.""

**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful

**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn't understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)

**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan

**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,

**FUD:** ""Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email""

**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gga6xbf895t81.jpg?width=1361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9ac72e87543a5f39f77664c4a134d5e3dda3cf5

There's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services

Also Lmao, linkedIn etc. FUD is nonsense, these guys are under NDA and are in the top 1 percentile of talent, networks not bound to these nonsense companies are not the sole arbiters of resources

**FUD:** ""This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure""

**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe . Also it's likely Apple and TMTG have a deal since it seems everything is an Apple exclusive at first and their marketcap has been doing well (see that section in the above DD)

>**What Happened:** According to a [Variety](https://www.benzinga.com/)report citing data from the analytics firm **Conviva**, **World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.'s**¬†(NYSE:[WWE](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/WWE#NYSE)) **WrestleMania 38** drew a combined 2.2 billion impressions across all social media platforms in its April 9-10 presentation, whereas the **NFL‚Äôs Super Bowl LVI** brought in 1.8 billion impressions on Feb. 13.

>Everyone wants to know what is on Truthsocial, it is the digital platform for the entire reformed republican party with the midterms coming up. It is highly relevant in the culture war and the reimplantation of fair meritocracy based content (that is aside from politics) the removal of shadow banning, bots, and algorithmic manipulation. There has never been an agreed centralized effort for everyone to regroup. It doesn't become relevant until traction is there.

&#x200B;

# Rumble Reports added 9M users QoQ , 22% QoQ

**FUD:** ""Trump steaks""

**Counter:** Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.

*The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.*

**FUD:** ""Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology""

**Counter:** I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.

**FUD:** ""Open source"" ""Bad security"" ""Software licensing""

**Counter:** Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in. Rumor of Thiel involvement (he was raising money for campaigning with DJT junior recently)  I wouldn't be surprised if Palantir is involved in some way for security.

I'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.

**FUD**

Drop in downloads etc.

**Counter**

It's in load test phase, and still the fastest growing platform in history. Do your own research, fake news would have you buy Twitter right now while it's about to get clapped.

**Conclusion**

There's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO

I have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once more hard data rolls in (in the coming weeks), if not then by the time the revenue rolls in.  The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.

Unfortunately, /u/zjz will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit.

1612063277.0,GME Week of Feb 1 Strategy,"I got in on this party quite late; initially watching from the sidelines. On Thursday, when all the Robinhood chaos unfolded and the price artificially plummeted, I saw the opportunity to jump in and picked up a single, Feb 19th $320 call.

**Come Monday, I'm prepared to buy up to $100k+ worth of stock and/or options.** However, I first want to explore a couple of various scenarios that we may see play out and think through the potential effects with you guys ... no matter how unlikely they are. I'll try to be succinct.

# Scenario 1: issuance of new blocks of stock at ~market value

**EDIT: THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE ( I was not aware )**

&#x200B;

~~If I'm not mistaken, Q1 for Gamestop begins Feb 1. Say they want to capitalize on everything by essentially, sending a bailout package to hedge funds - the very ones responsible for shorting them in the first place. This would be in an effort to shore up their finances and provide them enough capital to easily explore ways to adapt their business. Likely, this would come with strings attached. e.g. Hedge funds receiving new shares cannot sell for n years.~~

**~~Potential Outcomes:~~**

1. ~~HFs close out their short positions and short interest plummets. No more squeeze looks promising because the only shorts remaining would be those which shorted in the $300+ range. üíéüôå don't have a strong incentive to hold, nor try to compete against these remaining shorts. Retail selling begins.~~
2. ~~?~~

# Scenario 2: short interest isn't all telling

We are all aware that short interest is extremely high - quite likely still over 100%. However, with the recent blast of all media coverage from *reputable* networks, all are claiming Melvin, Citron, and Muddy Waters have all closed their short positions. I find this hard to believe and suspect. Sounds like a shitty PR campaign and obvious plea/attempt to instill fear.

Let's just assume that these reports are true. We can then infer that this extremely high short interest is more likely held near the $77, $160, $380 - $483 levels (just taking daily highs).

If that's the case, for the sake of argument, let's assume the $77 shorts have closed their positions - helping drive the price up to the next levels.

**Potential Impact:**

1. Short interest remains extremely high, but the current market value ($325) is not enough pressure to initiate a squeeze - assuming these firms have enough capital to not be in danger of a margin call. Or, perhaps those that are in trouble, have decided to sell off other positions in the market to remain in good standing - hence the overall market decline this week.

**Potential Outcomes:**

   1. üíéüôåstay impenetrable. However, it becomes an extremely long dragged out war until they get tired of paying the short interest fees which are insanely high - especially for new shorts.
   2. üíéüôå turn paper. Without deep pockets, we would need continued institutional longs to help push this into a squeeze.

&#x200B;

There are plenty of holes in each scenario on why it's so unlikely or not possible. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this as well.

1609805068.0,Why a Dem Sweep could Spell BIG BIG Trouble for Tech beyond Tax Increases,"As of late, Democrats have surged in the Georgia Senate run-offs, which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations, especially non-profitable ones.

So why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?

A couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**

Generally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over¬†$5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which¬†leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is¬†welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices.¬†

Summary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates

**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**

For all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more¬†here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc).¬†

That said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons.¬†

**Crowded Long Tech Trade**

It's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.

**A Quick Note on Leverage**

Hedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the ""Quant Quake"" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.

**Conclusion/TLDR**

A blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.

1691770994.0,The job market is collapsing and you are a REGARD if you are bullish.,"FACT: The only thing that has kept the US from recession has been the strong employment picture. The latest jobs report showed the employment picture worsening.

My anecdotal experience: Things are getting BAD. I've been looking for a new job for a few months now and I was getting interviews left and right in june. Things started slowing down in July and recently everything has straight up collapsed in August. Job postings that used to have less than 100 applicants have more than 300. I do realize summer hiring it typically lower, but the current hiring right now seems to be the worst it's been in years. Something happened over the past month and I fully think the US economy is entering into the much discussed recession.

1621455285.0,"Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Mr. Cramer...","Funny, true (albeit sad) story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs someone else who also remembers and can corroborate ‚Äì and with all the un-checked bashing of Jim on this forum, I can‚Äôt imagine this post won‚Äôt make the cut, so here goes:  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show ‚Äì think it was ""Real Money"" or similar (well before his TV show).  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most ‚Äúamazing‚Äù woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.

**Cost to borrow:** Annual fee paid to borrow shares and use those shares to short the stock. The fee that the borrowers are paying are approximately 20%. For well over a year its been approximately 0.5-1%. 

Between the bounces of $50-$30 last year the cost to borrow was approx 1% which is $0.30-$0.50 per share. Currently we have 100% utilization since February. The current price is approx $6, 20% of $6 is $1.20 per share to borrow for a year in comparison to the 30-50 cents they paid last year.

When a stock tanks and hits its low, in the brains of many WSBers... the stock is done. Why buy? 

Yet that should be the opposite mentality people have. AMC hasn't had any bad news for it to come this low, so the price action seems mostly short and not fundamental. What does a short seller do when a stock hits its low? Same thing a long investor does when it peaks. **CLOSE POSITION**

**How do short sellers make money?** 

They make money in two ways, first is by closing position at it's lowest point and second would be by synthetic shorting via options and selling OTM calls to do so. The problem here is the cost to borrow is getting expensive. synthetic shorting seems to be hitting a wall with the price not getting lower, the IV is low as hell so they arent profiting. Sooner, rather then later... the stock might have no where else to go but go up.

Now here's the thing... if it goes up from here, options are dirt cheap to exercise. Comparable to $50 \[$5,000\] per contract to exercise... it only costs approx $600 to exercise. If this thing were to rip, things could get crazy quick, exercising is cheapest its been in a LONG time.

a quick look at their fins says it all. before merger

aphria sold 41m usd in weed last quarter
tlry sold 31 million

after merger, they recently reported 52m in weed sales which accounted for 100% apha and 4wks worth of tlry. which meant they were flat in sales qoq. these are like tier 3 mso numbers. 

on top of which, they're carrying about 3b in good will (most of it came from tlry) and 250m of weed inventory.  at their sales rate, it would take them over 2yrs to sell that. more than likely they would need to write down a signifcant portion of that inventory at some point. 

and they're valued at 7b. 

now they're looking to dilute further for some red herring that looks like mso acquisition but still smells like herring. truth is 1) they need to continue to acquire to grow rev to (hopefully, but doubtful)  justify their valuation since they can't sell weed (remember flat qoq growth and ballooning inventory) 2) they can't afford a tier 1 or 2 mso. 

institutional investors only hold about 10% of their float which is among the lowest of their peers. hell even aurora is 18% (which, in itself, is lunacy). canopy is about 25%. village farms near 40%. 10% are mso numbers and msos trade on the OTC where most funds can't invest!

skip the company pr, look at the official fins, check out their valuation, compare their numbers to any mso, and you'll come to the same conclusions. 

oh, and the current ceo makes outlandish money https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/ouspzi/-/h762qcd.  note that the old tlry ceo Brendan Kennedy continues to dump his shares faster than you can say weedstocks. the guy is no dummy https://wallmine.com/people/64826/brendan-kennedy

1626212632.0,SPCE Hypersonic plane,"Jeff Bezos is trying to down play Sir Richard Branson & Virgin Galactic's outstanding performance traveling into outer space this past weekend. 

Jeff Bezos is saying ""50 miles up is not outer space, but that 60 miles up is outer space."" Meanwhile when Bezos goes up (which won't happen because he's afraid to even get an elevator) they'll be going to the same threshold between 50¬†and 60 miles. The average person traveling into space without proper conditioning, will not be able to handle anything past that. 

While Sir Richard Branson has always been well ahead in the game. The comments from bezos show he hasn't been able to get over it, with all the excitement and news Virgin Galactic has posted and received. 

Virgin Galactic's plane was designed for hypersonic speed. Hypersonic flight is coming. The idea of a nice jaunt into outer space for a joyride sounds fun, nevertheless soon people are going to be able to take hypersonic planes as a means of transportation anywhere in the world within two ~ four hours flight time. That's the goal. 

There's also a big difference in the designs between all three space companies. Virgin Galactic is following the X aircraft design, specifically the Boeing X-20 Dyno. The other space companies are using old Apollo technology with a capsule perched a top a rocket that comes back through the upper atmosphere with parachutes deployed landing wherever the wind takes you. 

The most important part of Virgin Galactic's hypersonic plane design is the feathering braking system that lets the plane float down through the atmosphere like a badminton birdie. The feathering system is based on Rutan's designs. The¬†entire tail structure can rotate upward, giving the plane the ability to slow down and float like a feather as it re-enters the upper atmosphere. The plane then lands on a runway. I'll take the plane and land on a runway.",wallstreetbets,"SPCE Hypersonic plane Jeff Bezos is trying to down play Sir Richard Branson & Virgin Galactic's outstanding performance traveling into outer space this past weekend.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good.

**Tax Receivable Agreement(TRA) and Incremental Loan Warrants, skip this if you're not interested in boring SPAC's tax & loan stuff**

TRA is a common feature in companies that go public via the SPAC route.

Despite it's name, It's mainly a way for the pre-IPO owners to continue to extract value from the new public company even after they've sold all their shares. The TRA essentially makes it difficult to value a company and to predict earnings accurately, because the TRA liability and expense will depend on factors such as

* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion
* The gross profit of the company during that Q
* And the applicable tax rate for that company

For $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.

The Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,

[https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm](https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm)

you need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)

And here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)

The May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.

**Tax Receivable Agreement(TRA) and Incremental Loan Warrants, skip this if you're not interested in boring SPAC's tax & loan stuff**

TRA is a common feature in companies that go public via the SPAC route.

Despite it's name, It's mainly a way for the pre-IPO owners to continue to extract value from the new public company even after they've sold all their shares. The TRA essentially makes it difficult to value a company and to predict earnings accurately, because the TRA liability and expense will depend on factors such as

* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion
* The gross profit of the company during that Q
* And the applicable tax rate for that company

For $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.

The Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,

[https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm](https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm)

you need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)

And here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)

The May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.

# THE LINK to $GME

As I was analyzing PRPL, out of curiosity I've tried to find its biggest shorts. $PRPL has very low short interest, at only 4.2% of the shares outstanding. But you'll never guess who the top 2 shorts are

1612207934.0,REMX - The less volatile way to play derivates (rare earth metals) of the EV and Renewable Energy craze?,"*\[Posted this on another Stock Market subreddit accidentally (now deleted from there)\]*  

Disclaimer: Do your own DD. I am not a licensed/certified financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Just may personal point of view.

\*\*\*

[REMX](https://www.vaneck.com/etf/equity/remx/holdings/) is a Rare Earth Metals ETF that gives any portfolio broad exposure to all major rare earth metal miners and players in China, Australia and some more (e.g US including Lithium Americas and Livent).

This saves one from the hassle of trying to track individual Chinese or Australian RE mining / metal extraction companies while giving access to an industry that will be a key supplier to the EV market in China and abroad. The output of these companies is also critical for the renewable energy (wind) sector and electronics to a certain extent.

For all the talk of the US bringing back supply chains (or relying on MP materials), this is one sector that cannot be brought back in the immediate to short term. The ETF hit highs of 92 in Jan 2018 and I expect that in a high liquidity environment with policy emphasis on electrification it will touch and exceed those levels. The ATH of 2011 is 300+ but I am not sure how relevant that might be today (but is a technical indication of the last time we had a media driven rare earth metals craze).

In summary

\- If you are not sure which Rare Earth mining company to pick or you want exposure to the EV secular shift but are not sure which SPAC or EV maker will go to the moon, consider REMX (rare earth metals ETF)  
\- Solid performer over the last months, currently going through a pullback (83 to 75)  
\- Moves slow but steady and has strong tailwinds  
\- Not super volatile so easier to get out of if you find a new shiny thing  
\- OTM calls are cheap  
\- Most recent high within the last 2 years was 92

Full disclosure: I have one deep ITM call for Aug 2021 and some shares (small account holder). The ETF has done nicely for me over the last few months (got in at 40), and this current pullback might be a good time to buy.",wallstreetbets,"REMX - The less volatile way to play derivates (rare earth metals) of the EV and Renewable Energy craze? *\[Posted this on another Stock Market subreddit accidentally (now deleted from there)\]*

1661993105.0,Don‚Äôt make the same mistake that you made with Ryan Cohen in $BBBY again!!!,"In $BBBYs release this morning before their presentation they said they would sell an additional 12 MILLION shares.

The main point of this is if your bagholding here already don‚Äôt be a fool and get dumped on twice. When Ryan filed to sell his shares he did it IMMEDIATELY. There was no 90 day wait period or whatever BS the hopium dreamers was shouting about. He sold IMMEDIATELY.

With that in mind you should be extremely cautious about the company doing the exact same thing. They know the price of the stock right now is way higher than it should be.

1592655214.0,I watch the press conference so you don't have to: Why Florida will not be shutting down,"There is an imbecile in another post on WSB who's struggles to put his diaper on in the morning who's attempting to give shit investment advice about how Florida will need to shut down. In an effort to justify his mom's hard fought public school education that he got he attempted to use big nickel words and graphs to show Arizona and Florida are in a doomsday pact with their residents and they're all going to need to lockdown again, or everyone is going to die. As the title suggests I watched the press conference yesterday by Gov Destanis so you don't have to, and am here to give the corrected information about what's going on in the nations best run state. 

First, one thing to understand about Florida is due to the constant hurricane issues and the large old people population they have had the most detailed data and fastest reporting data in the nation. The governor does not get up on stage with a crap PowerPoint every day and have no actual color to add to everything, instead they have very granular data which cuts through the polical nonsense.  All data referenced in this post will be in the imgur link at the end. 

Second all their elder care facilities are still on high alert and locked down. These have not reported and travel into and out of them are still very limited and carefully monitored.  All PPD is directed towards the elder care facilities, with hospitals getting the over run. 

Okay now onto the data. Yesterday Gov Destatis had a 1 hour+ press conference were he said where the state was at and where it was heading too. I doubt anyone from this sub watched it as it started about 10 minutes after apple decided to tank the market by announcing they were closing 8 stores. 
 
In this press conference he first discussed why the number of infected was increasing. (Chart 1) he showed that all the new cases are from people who are under the age of 40. Which for 99.6% of all people will not result in death but at worse will be a bad flu. Further he went on to state that nation wide the only 2 people have died under the age of 30 who didn't have huge co-morbidities before they got Covid. Basically if you are healthy today and catch it you will be fine. 

He breaks the new infection numbers down even further in chart 4 if you wanted to look at age split.

He backs his claim about younger people not being at risk with Chart 2 showing how the death rate is doing a nose dive. If they were actually at risk of death and were dying we would see it.  Additionally, he said they aren't going into hospitals either, as there are more available beds now in June than there were at any point between now and March 1st.

So this is a crap investment group so I should post on what this means for the market. Here's the brass tax, young people getting infected is a really good thing. The world has seen at least 6 major Covid related massive illnesses that they've attempted to develop a vaccine for. Do you want to know how many were successful? ZERO. There will not be a vaccine for covid-19 either as it mutates too fast. There is only one way out of this, herd immunity. The faster young heathy people get infected and become immune the faster we can attempt to go back to normal.  Any doctor on TV telling you anything else is lying to you. Also remember, our grandparents lived through a great depression 3 pandemics and 2 world wars and kept on trucking. We can make it through this.

Long story short, invest in America buy quality long positions and enjoy the ride. Also fuck idiots telling you the world is going to end.

No country took remotely effective containment measures in the following weeks. STILL AREN'T.

Every country now has hot spots that are growing exponentially.

The WHO director, TODAY, said there was no pandemic. Total captured insanity. 

Every country on earth will mirror China. Only worse. Because every coronavirus complication drug and antibiotic comes from China, and China no longer exports them. For obvious reasons.

The coronavirus complication rate is 20%. Without treatment drugs and ICU level care that is what the fatality rate will climb to around the world.

1613140949.0,Hey WSB - You ARE the goddamn hedgefund!,"Fuck you. 

Yes you.

I wasn't bothering anyone.  I simply woke up, checked my watchlist, and decided, after 3 MONTHS - three months - of tracking APHA, Wednesday was the day to buy. 

It always moved nicely.  Outpaced the sector, held firm when the sector took a hit. 

It didn't seem 'flashy', or 'gambling'.

It was just little ol me, who had been enjoying 100% gains over the past 12 months, cautiously, carefully, casually buying stocks I liked and accruing them. 

APHA was moving, and I astutely determined, ""People are waking up that this is the right play.  Time to pounce!""

Pounce I did. 

That night, I texted a buddy.  ""Hey, did you see know that APHA was being discussed over in WSB?  I hope this price jump isn't because of those guys...""

Next day, champagne!!!!! Up 40% in 24 hours????  Boy did I time that or did I time that?

I say to you sirs:  DID I TIME THAT?

I am sitting here down more in 24 hours than I've ever been down in my life.

You are a hedge fund.  A market manipulating hedge fund.

Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about

&#x200B;

**Thesis:** 

This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts

&#x200B;

Looking at the yahoo options chain ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&straddle=true)) and we end the week around the current price (say, $107):

&#x200B;

Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337

Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797

Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added **946,000 shares worth of selling pressure** 

On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote, **they will be selling shares as prices drop** to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM

&#x200B;

1614607357.0,EVs are not the future! Please read this!,"Good morning my fellow fellows and non-fellows. I have discovered something that makes me feel uneasy and i feel that it needs to be shared.. something is BIG is going down, i have three things i would like to cover in this post, Rhodium; the uses of it, OPOC two stroke engines and the US Army and how the three are connected to a company that created this technology that just vanished off the face of the earth after proving combustion engines can be cleaner and more efficient then anything we can do with electric for the foreseeable future..

The Beginning of My Research : This started back in 2008 with a company called EcoMotors, i am and always have been obsessed with two-stroke engines as the power they can output is truly unmatched.. i discovered EcoMotors because they designed a two-stroke opposed piston opposed cylinder engine that would create a significant higher power output, using less fuel, including a lower count of moving parts and major cutbacks on overall weight, far surpassing the efficiency of EVs. Bill Gates was invested heavily in this company... then China got involved, a massive deal to produce 150'000 units of this engine was struck in China and then suddenly.. it all goes dark, no more news, no explanation.. the company shuts down, the production plant is deemed ""defunct"" and all of the information and patents owned by the company were privately purchased and essentially removed from the public eye.

Where it Gets Weird; Rhodium : As an investor i'm actively looking for the ""next big thing"" as we all are and i have a soft spot for precious metals ( they're just so shiny ) through countless hours of sifting through the garbage pile that we call the internet i discovered a PGM ( platinum group metal ) called Rhodium and this little shiny turd is a golden boy in the world of precious metal right now, it has rocketed from roughly $2'200/oz to over $22'000/oz from 2018 - 2021 with no signs of stopping anytime soon, the primary use ( literally over 80% of all mined rhodium ) is in catalytic converters used on internal combustion engines, the whole market is pushing EVs and yet Rhodium is skyrocketing in value.. it makes no sense if the world is going electric right? Very very odd.. 

THE PLOT THICKENS! : So now knowing that there is a type of combustion engine in play that crushes the efficiency of anything electric and that it's been around for years.. on top of that a catalyst metal that would be directly used with engines of this variety is rocketing in value behind the scenes while EV has the spotlight.. it makes you wonder.. why isn't it being used in everyday transportation? Because it's so damn good the military wanted it first, Achates Power landed a contract with the US Army in the end of 2020 to produce high efficiency opoc engines for all of the vehicles in the US Army throughout 2021. So ask yourself this.. if EV is the future, why is the most power military force in the world investing in the development of high efficiency internal combustion two-stroke opocs, we are being lied to above EVs and have been for years. Please spread this information, this truly is a very viable alternative to EVs as it wouldn't require restructuring our society to accommodate battery powered retard-mobiles. 

I strongly believe this information is being suppressed, it took me countless hours to uncover this and it's not a conspiracy, all of this is happening and i personally care deeply about the future of this planet ( i'm sure we all do ) people need to know about so please, share.

So I‚Äôve been watching these rallies on both sides at the toss-up states and yes, it‚Äôs very much one-sided. 

1. Trump has so many more people showing up to rallies and it seems like he has the physical numbers advantage compared to Biden. Well Biden supporters might be scared of COVID and might be watching it from their homes?

2. Well, that‚Äôs exactly what I thought and did some investigation. But, it seems that there are more people tuned into Trump‚Äôs live broadcast than Biden‚Äôs. Well, most of the people might be on Trump‚Äôs livestream to hate on him. While this may be true,

3. The like-to-dislike ratio for Trump‚Äôs live stream was 550-190 vs Biden‚Äôs live stream 100-500. Well, it might be due to Media Broadcasting Bias?

4. Sure, except they‚Äôre both being broadcasted via Yahoo Finance - least biased News channel. Then, maybe Youtube is home to more right-wing individuals? Google tells me that Youtube has more left-leaning individuals than right-leaning individuals. To better understand statistics, I‚Äôve decided to peruse CNN and FOX's Youtube Channels.

5. The haters of CNN are gigantic. Much more in comparison to FOX hates. Check out CNN's recent videos and look at the like-dislike ratio. It‚Äôs incomparable to FOX‚Äôs.

6. Not only CNN though. Check out CTV, CBS, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, etc. (which are all left-wing) and check out their like-dislike ratio. It‚Äôs insurmountable.

What do they sell, idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Random ass sharper image shit and pillows or something?

My wife sometimes takes me to buy buy baby and we always walk out with like a $650 car seat or some shit. It‚Äôs absolutely regarded.

I hate their stores, they‚Äôre boring as fuck and I usually want to slit my wrists after walking around in their aimlessly for 3 hours while my wife buys soda streams or some bullshit.

How does this relate to GME, AMC, etc‚Ä¶.

I also hate GameStop. Talk about overpriced, customer fucking bullshit. When MW2 came out I sold my PS2 and my entire collection of games, all of my guitar hero controllers, and still owed them like $20 just to get my copy. They likely turned around and made at least a couple hundred on all of my stuff. Why do I like this company? I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. Fuck them.

Remember AMC ??? Oh yeah, I remember being 16 and spending $80 to take my girlfriend to the movie, and get snacks. I hate AMC. 

Would I ever own shares of these companies? Absolutely not. The fact that these businesses still exist is insane. The internet solves all of the problems that these companies set out to address when they were first established. They‚Äôre absolute horseshit.

But that has nothing to do with the fact that people have traded and made a fuck ton of money on options contracts that use these companies shares as the underlying.

You get inherent leverage with OTM options contracts, and can put up much lower amounts of capital to achieve the same results that you would have if you held the correlated position in shares alone. If you‚Äôre buying long options, you‚Äôll also never end up as a shareholder of a dogshit company (unless you want to be). 

Most options contracts expire worthless so you‚Äôre also (most importantly) not giving the board of directors free money by way of share price increase that they can turn around and dilute you with. 

Dilution is a good thing if you actually believe in the company because they‚Äôre effectively raising cash that they can use for development. If you‚Äôre giving a company that sucks a ton of money, they‚Äôre just going to turn around a give their entire board raises for ‚Äúdoing a great job‚Äù for the quarter. 

Philosophically apes seem to be preaching a dystopian reality in which they‚Äôre all standing together and getting rich together and fucking over hedge funds but in reality the only people getting fucked over are the retail investors. Hedge funds are hedged (duh) if they have a manager that‚Äôs not artistic and can take on the losses (if any). Market makers make money on the trading volume, the company‚Äôs board gets paid, long term holders can finally sell their garbage shares, and options traders make and lose money like usual.

STOP BUYING SHARES of COMPANIES YOU DONT BELIEVE in. STOP EXERCISING SHARES that are OTM. 

If you do, it‚Äôs nobodies fault but your own. Stop bitching and putting more regulatory scrutiny on our backs. You are burning money. This is a CASINO, not an investment club. 

Regulators either don‚Äôt give a fuck,or don‚Äôt get this game. Any regulation ‚Äúto protect us‚Äù literally just makes it harder for little guys to have any shot at life changing money.

Look at you. You‚Äôre a male and probably single. You use [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) for your social interactions because you don‚Äôt go anywhere on the weekends and wait for market open to gamble your life savings away since you have no wife or even kids to care for. 

So now enter Reddit in 2022. How is Reddit going to compete with the metaverse and keep your cucked eyeballs on here instead of VR? Now while we all may think the metaverse and VR is stupid, it‚Äôs where our worlds heading. 

So how does Reddit fit in to the [metaverse?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/07/virtual-reality-check-when-will-the-metaverse-vision-become-a-reality/amp/) Imagine Reddit right now. You open it, and see a series of threads or questions on a server. You read and reply. 

Now imagine being in a VR Reddit open world. There will be a central lobby where everyone starts out. Ever play COD WW2? Similar to that type of [lobby](https://youtu.be/JrU-aT5TNBM) where everyone chills until they go into a certain game. You essentially choose a ‚Äúsub‚Äù to go into and you can talk to people in real time about the thread. So let‚Äôs say someone starts a conversation on wsb about how $KO is a buy, you‚Äôd basically be in a huge room with everyone else in the thread talking about it in real time. Reddit will eventually serve as the ultimate social server in the metaverse. The Redditverse! You‚Äôll also be able to watch past threads and talk to them in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù because it‚Äôs all VR. 

The sad reality of this is if you think escapism is bad now? Oh boy, wait until everyone just meets people on the Redditverse and they never have any friends in real life. Wait until your wife finds her boyfriend in the Redditverse and he‚Äôs jacked online but some balding 40 year old virgin cuck in real life.

**THE MARKET**

My guess is Reddit will IPO sometime this year. It may go down like $HOOD at first. This will be the best time to yolo. Now, my guess is Reddit will be bought out by Meta. Now most people will be confused by this, but Facebook knows it will be making the Redditverse. More people like Reddit than Facebook, so it‚Äôs perfect.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. selected asset manager Sixth Street Partners to supply new financing, according to people familiar with the matter, as doubts remain among vendors and some investors about the company‚Äôs turnaround prospects.

Sixth Street is in exclusive talks with Bed Bath & Beyond and is nearing final terms for a loan of close to $400 million to shore up the troubled retailer‚Äôs liquidity, according to people familiar with the matter. Negotiations to finalize the loan documents are ongoing, one of the people said.

The company told prospective lenders it had selected a proposal for an asset-based loan, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter. Bed Bath & Beyond stock climbed as much as 30% on Wednesday, closing up 18% at $10.36.

A loan deal would help refill the company‚Äôs coffers and give confidence to vendors that Bed Bath & Beyond can pay its bills. The business has sought to stretch payments to some vendors, which have been pulling credit to the company in recent weeks amid mounting doubts that it could pay them back and a shortage of credit insurance, according to people familiar with the matter.

At least one firm that finances suppliers has stopped providing credit on shipments to Bed Bath & Beyond, the Journal has reported.

The loan is structured as a first-in-last-out facility, meaning it is backed by collateral but will only be paid out after other secured debt in the event of bankruptcy, the people said.

Sixth Street Partners manages $60 billion in assets, and has a retail lending practice that has made loans to retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. and DSW Inc.

The loan is part of a broader plan by the company to shore up its finances. Bed Bath & Beyond indicated earlier this month that it is in talks with lenders and its professional advisers to strengthen its balance sheet and would provide a comprehensive update later in August.

But given its high cash burn in the second quarter, the company will likely need to secure more support from investors to give it runway to execute its restructuring plan.

‚ÄúThe loan would provide a couple more quarters of time to show improvement operationally and appease vendors,‚Äù said Seth Basham, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre skeptical of their ability to generate cash in the short term, if they can show that they can improve their margins and free cash flow through the holidays, that could be a path to regain investor confidence.‚Äù

Traditional debt markets may not be a viable route for the retailer to raise new capital. Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs bonds are trading at deeply distressed levels, indicating that any new debt issued by the company may be prohibitively costly with effective yields above 25%.

The Union, N.J., retailer does have a path to issue millions of new shares, potentially helping the company secure an additional lifeline. Bed Bath & Beyond hasn‚Äôt indicated yet whether it expects to issue new shares.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre surprised that the company didn‚Äôt try to issue shares,‚Äù said Bradley Thomas, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ‚ÄúIt would have been silly not to at least consider it given where the stock was trading.‚Äù

The company has been closing stores, reducing corporate overhead and renegotiating contracts with vendors as it looks to cut costs, but its cash burn has deepened in recent months as sales have fallen. Unsecured bonds backed by the company trade between 15 and 30 cents on the dollar, a sign that investors doubt they‚Äôll be paid back in full.

The receipt of a loan may abate some of those concerns. Bond traders at Goldman Sachs Group quoted Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs bonds between five and 10 points higher Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.

Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, more than quadrupling this month through Wednesday as investors bet the retailer could become the next distressed company to harness stock-market exuberance to raise funds from enthusiastic shareholders. The stock dropped after activist investor Ryan Cohen sold all of his stake, but it is still up 80% this month.",wallstreetbets,"Bed Bath & Beyond's Challenges Linger After Loan Deal [Link to WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-bath-beyonds-challenges-linger-after-loan-deal-11661378955)

Sixth Street Partners manages $60 billion in assets, and has a retail lending practice that has made loans to retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. and DSW Inc.

The loan is part of a broader plan by the company to shore up its finances. Bed Bath & Beyond indicated earlier this month that it is in talks with lenders and its professional advisers to strengthen its balance sheet and would provide a comprehensive update later in August.

But given its high cash burn in the second quarter, the company will likely need to secure more support from investors to give it runway to execute its restructuring plan.

‚ÄúThe loan would provide a couple more quarters of time to show improvement operationally and appease vendors,‚Äù said Seth Basham, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre skeptical of their ability to generate cash in the short term, if they can show that they can improve their margins and free cash flow through the holidays, that could be a path to regain investor confidence.‚Äù

Traditional debt markets may not be a viable route for the retailer to raise new capital. Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs bonds are trading at deeply distressed levels, indicating that any new debt issued by the company may be prohibitively costly with effective yields above 25%.

The Union, N.J., retailer does have a path to issue millions of new shares, potentially helping the company secure an additional lifeline. Bed Bath & Beyond hasn‚Äôt indicated yet whether it expects to issue new shares.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre surprised that the company didn‚Äôt try to issue shares,‚Äù said Bradley Thomas, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ‚ÄúIt would have been silly not to at least consider it given where the stock was trading.‚Äù

The company has been closing stores, reducing corporate overhead and renegotiating contracts with vendors as it looks to cut costs, but its cash burn has deepened in recent months as sales have fallen. Unsecured bonds backed by the company trade between 15 and 30 cents on the dollar, a sign that investors doubt they‚Äôll be paid back in full.

The receipt of a loan may abate some of those concerns. Bond traders at Goldman Sachs Group quoted Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs bonds between five and 10 points higher Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.

Bed Bath & Beyond‚Äôs shares have been on a roller-coaster ride, more than quadrupling this month through Wednesday as investors bet the retailer could become the next distressed company to harness stock-market exuberance to raise funds from enthusiastic shareholders. The stock dropped after activist investor Ryan Cohen sold all of his stake, but it is still up 80% this month."

1613056930.0,GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time.,"I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to ""stick it to the big guys.""  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

Hey everyone, oickles here! You may have known me for my Ape mentality DD post a while back. I wanted to give you a quick update on what's been going on since I've written that post and even further analysis on why I think Apes are fukt.


#The Breaking Point


Apes have been reaching breaking points as their beloved stock crumbles before their very eyes. One notable instance is going on with the AMC community where, their [stock-tubers are getting suicidal DMs from apes who threw in entire life savings into the stock hoping for a Moass.(I had to remove the link due to the mod removing it)
  This isn't a game, people are really reaching their breaking point with meme stocks, what you may see in the next 2 weeks may be huge selloffs. People are throwing everything they have to keep the stock propped up [see here](https://imgur.com/gallery/6PUWI9w).


This concludes that apes and retail in general is running out of ammo. The free money from the stimulus has ran out, life savings, any free money that was for benefits even has ran out and they are truly fukt. Apes have cornered themselves in a fortress of shit and are flinging it also at each other while convincing themselves that RC or DFV will come from the heavens and save them. The stocks cannot keep up it's inflated price and the stock will continue to tumble; it's inevitable and a reality for most apes as they watch their life savings go down the drain.


#Gamestop


Gamecock has been the front-runner for most stock investors, its wild volatile swings have been astounding for swing traders. Recently SS had deleted a user's post for making 6 Million dollars from swing trading the stock stating; ""They didnt want other users to follow his example"". Yeah they want the apes to keep bagholding because that's how you make money? You've been brainwashed into thinking that buying a stock makes you money instead of swing trading it. I'd rather pay 45% taxes on 3 million instead of 30% on 20k. I'm just saying..


Gamestop as a company is burning cash with no potential room for growth, revenue and a future. [The stock is essentially burning cash from 1.7Bill to 1.5B and dropping](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-gme/gamestop/news/gamestop-nysegme-has-debt-but-no-earnings-should-you-worry-1). The apes would have you believe that the price doesnt matter, the earnings doesnt matter, nothing matters except the DD and this is how you form a cult. You've been gaslighted into losing your money, your hard earned investments and hopes and dreams over a stock that will probably never return to the ATH you sold them for. 


Gamestop doesnt fit in the NFT marketplace and here's why that bullshit pitch is nothing less than copium. Apes with their short termed memory proposed the NFT dividend to expose naked shorting and start the Moass as to what they believe ""we own the float multiple times and a dividend to count each stock would expose the overshorting of the stock"". This fell apart when there was no dividend announced and the Cult leaders had to come up with another tangible lie to keep the Ape's invested. All of a sudden GME is a ""Fundamentals play"" when all before ""Fundamentals don't matter"", ""it's a squeeze play"". I personally asked Gamers how they felt about NFTs and they responded VERY NEGATIVELY 

Gamestop investors are trying so hard to preach and push NFTs when:

1. NOONE WANTS IT, OUTSIDE OF THE SHITFLINGING APES.

2. NO Developer who would issue an NFT, would ever lose potential profits to a brick and mortar store when they could sell it directly out of their own stores. 

The reason why GME is failing and so hated amoung developers is because, they resell used games and do not pay the companies of the games they resell. [Most of, if not all of the profits goes towards GME and this causes alot of lost revenue.](https://youtu.be/703cX_edBlk). You coukd say that game skins from Call of Duty are NFTs, but noone is going to GameStop to buy COD skins. You can buy the skins straight from Sony store, then buy Cod points and get the skin.


Everything is becoming mainstream, NFTs doesn't fit GameStop's narrative and if anything accelerated it's death. You can buy a ps5 from Sony and Amazon or UPS will deliver it, noone needs Gamestop anymore and it's earnings report proves it. Losing 500 Million dollars while increasing in 300 Mill in inventory is not bullish. It means less people are buying and they cannot sell the products they have to compensate. 

#FUD, Shills, Bears?

Anything negative about gamestop gets downvoted and noted as ""Paid Shill, Bot and FUD"", so here's what I'm going to do for the apes. Im going to list out some cult signs and debunk some theories about this ""paid shills"".

Signs of a cult:

1. The leader is the ultimate authority (DFV, AA, RC, DD grifters)


 ""If you‚Äôre not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cults¬†begin with a charismatic leader who claims some supreme knowledge. They may call themselves a prophet, messiah, messenger, or an enlightened teacher. They can also be CEOs, military officials, politicians, and self-help gurus.""

2. The group suppresses skepticism (FUD, Shill, Bot)


 If you‚Äôre only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult.


3. The group delegitimizes former members (If you leave, you're a paperhanded bitch)

If you can‚Äôt think of a legitimate reason for leaving your group, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Because the cult considers itself the ultimate authority on truth, it can‚Äôt imagine anybody leaving it with their integrity intact. Thus, it has to perpetuate a false narrative that former members were deceived, proud, immoral, or lazy.

4.The group is paranoid about the outside world (Everyone is in on it. Amazon, SEC, DTCC, Citadel, CIA, FBI)

If your group insists the end of the world is near, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cults position themselves as the sole refuge from an evil outside world that is intent on their destruction. Cults thrive on conspiracy theories, catastrophic thinking, and persecution complexes.


5.The group relies on shame cycles (As shown in one of my pictures, the apes need support because noone believes them)

If you need your group in order to feel worthy, loved, or sufficient, you‚Äôre probably in a cult.
Cult leaders trap members in shame cycles by imposing abnormally strict codes of conduct (usually prescriptions about diet, appearance, sex, relationships, media), guilting members for their shortcomings, and then positioning themselves as the unique remedy to the feelings of guilt which they themselves created

#Earnings and how to gauge them

Gamestop Q4 earnings are good however; we can compare them by a year by year analysis to see what direction the business is headed in: [Here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)

Even with the Ape and stock boost, Gamestop is still a failing company that DFV fairly valued at 20-40 dollars. He never cited a Moass and this is what caused the downfall of most apes.

It's honestly a shame to see this, you guys could've been a market terror causing short squeezes all over and getting rich. You instead got yourselves and everyone else involved with your Moass propaganda and Everyone can see through your shit. (link removed)

That being said, the stock will continue to tumble even with the small rips it will have. Call it a bear flag if you must, but this stock is going to 20 fast and once Apes wake up and realize they have been duped, I could honestly see [terrorist acts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s4pswk/at_least_they_get_nfts/) being attempted on DD writers and RC for not delivering the promised Moass.

Apes, get out and get some help, reconnect with your loved ones and admit you have a issue. You can rebuild what you've lost, do not wait until it's all gone to try because this will happen [to you](https://www.joshuakennon.com/gt-advanced-technologies-bankruptcy/)

Cult leaders trap members in shame cycles by imposing abnormally strict codes of conduct (usually prescriptions about diet, appearance, sex, relationships, media), guilting members for their shortcomings, and then positioning themselves as the unique remedy to the feelings of guilt which they themselves created

#Earnings and how to gauge them

Gamestop Q4 earnings are good however; we can compare them by a year by year analysis to see what direction the business is headed in: [Here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)

Even with the Ape and stock boost, Gamestop is still a failing company that DFV fairly valued at 20-40 dollars. He never cited a Moass and this is what caused the downfall of most apes.

It's honestly a shame to see this, you guys could've been a market terror causing short squeezes all over and getting rich. You instead got yourselves and everyone else involved with your Moass propaganda and Everyone can see through your shit. (link removed)

That being said, the stock will continue to tumble even with the small rips it will have. Call it a bear flag if you must, but this stock is going to 20 fast and once Apes wake up and realize they have been duped, I could honestly see [terrorist acts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s4pswk/at_least_they_get_nfts/) being attempted on DD writers and RC for not delivering the promised Moass.

Apes, get out and get some help, reconnect with your loved ones and admit you have a issue. You can rebuild what you've lost, do not wait until it's all gone to try because this will happen [to you](https://www.joshuakennon.com/gt-advanced-technologies-bankruptcy/)

Edit: You can see users like Bigstonkguy that are making a killing from shorting. Shorts are not fucked, Apes are. I believe that Gamestop will see double digitals before a Grand Scale Meltdown."
1616736461.0,"OG's don't hate $GME, just a chunk of the people trading it: Stop being cultish it's cringey and annoying -- let's clear some shit up and dispel some $GME myths","**TLDR: You don't know you're in a cult until you know you're in a cult.** Let the downvotes flow, I really am not doing this for karma. I'm doing this so some of you change your behavior and because the sub matters to me.

Disclaimer: I have puts on $GME, sold my $80s and $100s on the rip down yesterday, and twice had shares/calls, and will perhaps have shares and calls again if it ever goes back down a long ways because I'm here to make money.

**My background:** Been trading this sub's ideas since 2016 silently, my prop firm friends turned me onto this place (they do listen/watch this sub). I used to post DD for the week from my personal notebook each week back in 2019, I had thousands of people waiting each Sunday for those DD posts. Someone contacted my wife/tried to doxx me on the street, it freaked me out, I deleted the old account (SoRefreshing). I'm not a shill, or a bear, or any of that shit. I work for myself and trade at home now. I'll start my DD up again when the GME shit dies down, I can't do the posts because: I would instantly get labeled a shill or distraction or a hedgie or some stupid other fucking shit which is the reason for this post.

**In short:** The people here that have been around pre-GME or especially pre 2019 probably share the same sentiment that they're sick of $GME. It's not because of the quality/length of time this has been a phenomenon here, or even the trade itself, we love when stocks do what it is doing because many of us play both sides and make money in both directions, but we hate it **because of the absolutely cultish and ridiculous behavior of some of the people trading it.**

Personally, I think it should be an instantly temp-bannable offense to do some of the shit in this thread so that we can start cleaning up the ridiculous cultish behavior but whatever, you apes do you.

# The Right Reasons To Be In $GME:

1. **You like the turnaround story, and are willing to hold years to see it come to fruition.** This would be considered an investment, something almost nobody around here has experience with.
2. **You are simply gambling to gamble, and like the stock.** Sure, buy it up, you're going to have some juicy loss porn if you never sell (and if you're retarded enough to not sell at $500+ and again at $300+ honestly you deserve it)
3. **You like to not be left out.** I get it, everybody is buying it, so you bought some. Whatever, we've all done it. This is a stupid reason but exponentially better than the shit the new normies spread around the daily Financial Jonestown thread (stolen from another WSBer, credit for the person that claims it idk who it was)

&#x200B;

# The Wrong Reasons To Be in GME:

1. **You think a squeeze is coming to $10,000.** It isn't. People should literally get instabanned for saying this shit because there are people stupid enough to believe it. Granted, that's their bad for being so stupid, but this won't happen (I expand on that below) mostly because the system CANNOT let it happen. You're playing a rigged game, get over it.
2. **You think you're bankrupting hedge funds.** You're not. They'll get a bailout if you do, or another one of their buddies will step in and cannibalize them. Stop being silly.
3. **You have any personal vendetta or motive.** It's stupid to trade on emotions. Do it if you want, keep telling people you're holding but stop attacking people that sell or have a contrarian idea. Believe it or not: **Not selling at $300+ or $250 and having it crash back down to $40 with the heavy ass bags you have isn't badass, it's ridiculous. We're here to make money.** Even if you believe the turnaround -- it's stupid. I love some of my holdings but if they gain a pile in a short time, I take some profit off the table because I want to be a boyfriend and not a cuck some day.
4. **If you think every drop is a ""short ladder"" or ""short attack"".** Some people just sell their shares. Some people need the money and they shouldn't be investing in $GME if so but, that's life.

&#x200B;

Ranting and explanations of some of the points:

&#x200B;

1. **There's no massive squeeze coming, ever. The best you can hope for is to crush individual shorts into adding volume when they buy back,** but the hedge funds aren't the ones you're beating up on. Citadel will win the war in the end because they can stay liquid longer than all of the holdings in $GME combined. **More importantly, if they're still in, they're hedged, you can guarantee it. Gabe almost got the fund torched,** but he got a bailout from his buddies. Listen, they won't let it happen, it WILL NOT HAPPEN. If you are playing this for a squeeze, then you are in it for the WRONG REASONS. If the first run up to $500+ didn't get shorts out, then they re-shorted at $500 and covered lower. You can be guaranteed shorts that didn't are operational shorts (to hedge put contracts, hedge fund, **hedge**) and play into the price almost not at all. In the impending run up to $300+ recently, the shorts likely cycled again, people covering, and re-shorting. This will lead to compoundingly low highs as people are more likely to cover to not get caught under a squeeze. Each time it happens, it will gain less momentum, what you're seeing is weeks of consolidation into a price range driven by algos and the apes here with money. **$100,000 or even $1,500 a share** from a squeeze is a **COMPLETE meme.** If it hits those price levels, it's for sure massive whales playing games against each other, not because you're bankrupting hedge funds. To double from $500 to $1,000 takes another DOUBLE of the market cap. Today, at around $185 the cap sits at $13B give or take. To double to $370 would require $13B of inflows. Each time it goes up, it exponentially gets harder for retail to have impact on the price but also for it to continue going up. Institutions - because of their fiduciary responsibility - aren't buying this to put in client portfolios. More importantly, the higher it goes up, the more likely a fund has to rebalance the fund's holdings (IE: liquidate literally millions of shares) since one stock would then provide too much risk and they have a responsibility to take profits. The entire system is designed to work against squeezes like the VW one (which is awesome to talk about, but a completely different time, and different situation than we face now.) It's just not happening.
2. **The second time it ran from $40 up to $100+ was not retail volume.** This easily could have been a massive short from $500+ closing it out and riding up call contracts during their closeout. It could have just been a complete bait. There's a reason it floated around back at $40 when the algos turned off. Some days when you watch the price action the volume is dead, the price isn't jumping up and down rapidly, this is a sign there's less machines trading it. HFT firms likely jumped back on board when it got super volatile because that's when they make the most money, by scalping the spread. You could literally just be at the mercy of machines fighting each other right now, this could be some retail volume but the slow bleed from $330 to $180 then the crash after earnings leads me to believe it's far less retail and more algos playing the momentum. Sure, some of you are buying shares, but I think you are really over-estimating the amount of shares people have and the impact we have on this.
3. **There is no fucking movement.** This is the biggest one I think. You aren't in this together with anyone and you should stop with the ""hold HOLD!"" shit to other people. You're in this alone, either you're in it to make money, or you're in it for the wrong reasons. You're not putting a real dent into hedge funds, stop being fucking ignorant if you aren't doing it just for the dank memes. I know a guy that killed himself over money in the market, someone telling him to ""HOLD"" on a play, and he lost it all. Tell people you're holding, tell people you think it's stupid to sell, but knock off the shit with massively downvoting people that sell or telling people that sold to fuck off, etc. This is what annoys people from this sub that built the culture the most. Chances are 80% of the people playing this are doing so with money they can't afford to lose - if they choose to share their loss porn then they deserve the needle and should be prepared to accept it, if not, then you're in this ALONE.
4. **There's no fucking shills.** Not everyone that is contrarian to your confirmation bias is a shill. CNBC isn't in cahoots to spread FUD, there is a lot of veterans on Wall Street that have seen exactly what is going on before, multiple times. Just because they say the valuation is ridiculous doesn't mean they're missing anything. Real statistics showing 20% short interest instead of 100%+ aren't shills, they're just telling you the truth. It already squeezed. We just know this is a fucking pump and dump of gigantic proportions. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but this mother fucker is coming piling back down (for a second time) and some of you are going to hold some very, very heavy bags. There's no way around it.
5. **You guys are just playing a big game of chicken with each other.** If you're willing to do that, fine, but this is just a $13B pump and dump. Some unnamed institution may be buying up shares to push the price up, especially today, since they have a vested interest in the at the market offering sale in order to raise capital for GameStop and generate revenue for themselves. I won't name the name because you can go hunt it down if you want to know.
6. **The turnaround is priced in.** Believe it or not, when a company goes from a <$1B market cap to $13B if it holds these price levels, the turnaround is completely priced in an you could buy leap puts and it's printing money, who knows what amount, but it's printing money. Also: turnarounds like the one Cohen is executing take YEARS, not weeks, not months. You won't see appreciable movement in the numbers (which matter, whether you believe it or not) for years. Plus they're massively restructuring, and the chance GameStop still fails is a lot higher than people here give credit to. They need to drastically shift their business, and I believe they will, but it's not even 50/50. It's probably 70/30 that the business still fails completely, regardless how long you HODL your stock.

Yeah that's all I have. I'm just tired of the cultish shit coming from $GME people. A lot of us who say that shit or tease you in the $GME daily thread are just doing so because we hate the way this sub is transforming into some ridiculous GME sized version of the ""LET ME INNN"" meme.

At some point, it's just too much. I know others have hit their point, and I hit mine, so I made this post. Stop giving advice or doing DD posts if you have no fucking clue because you're not doing yourself a favor just by getting upvotes for confirmation bias. I just saw a guy point at declining volume on a DD post as proof that people are shorting downticks. Like what, the, fuck.

Just because you've been here a couple months and lost/made 100k doesn't make you a market expert. You're just a brainless mush clicking buttons like most people here.

I have puts right now. Yeah, I think it's gonna crash, no they don't expire this week, or next, or the one after, so I have plenty of time to wait. I'm already so far green and others are from playing both sides of this trade up and down there is no motive in this post as far as wanting you to sell for my puts, that doesn't matter to me in the scheme of things.

It's that I really used to love this place, and now it's fucking mind numbingly difficult to put up with it for more than a few minutes until I come across a post like: ""Why is it going down"" or ""Should I sell"" or ""$GME BABY FUCK EVEYONE ELSE SHILL SHILL SHILL"".

1694511660.0,Why Starbucks is losing to Luckin Coffee in China and why this likely won‚Äôt change.,"With Luckin‚Äôs 2nd Quarter earnings report, it‚Äôs impactful partnership with Moutai and soon with Victoria Secret, Luckin Coffee is making headlines for all the right reasons.  Yesterday‚Äôs CNBC headline ‚ÄúHow Luckin Coffee overtook Starbucks as the largest coffee chain in China‚Äù is turning even more heads.  As unbiased investors looking for opportunities it‚Äôs worth trying to understand where Starbucks lost ground and why Luckin is succeeding.

Starbucks has numerous disadvantages in China: 

-  Starbucks stores are largely in high-tier cities, so when Covid struck and these cities were being shut down, so too were more Starbucks. While Luckin Coffee does have stores in high-tier cities, they've largely targeted lower-tier cities. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Prior to Covid, Starbucks didn't have a well developed App for order and delivery. Luckin already did. So while Starbucks was playing catch-up, Luckin was expanding and building market share. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Starbucks stores are larger and designed to have a ""3rd space"". Luckin stores are small and efficiently designed for pick-up and delivery. So not only is Starbucks paying more for their real-estate but it costs more money and time to create a new store. In other words, Starbucks can't keep up with Luckin's growth, both in speed and the cost of development. Major problem for Starbucks.

- Luckin's selection of drinks cater more to Chinese tastes.

- Luckin is vertically integrated in China so they can reduce their prices and still profit.  Starbucks is seen as a luxury brand, so they can't reduce their prices too much without losing their identity as a luxury brand.

Over a year ago Luckin passed Starbucks in store count, now they've passed them in revenue.

What can't be forgotten is China's unique marketplace for coffee. It is literally the fastest growing coffee market in the world. In Starbucks entire history, they have never opened the number of stores Luckin has in one year - even globally! This isn't a knock on Starbucks, they deserve a great deal of credit for helping to develop the global coffee market, but the western coffee market is a mature one, and slow growing.  Meanwhile in China, things are just getting started.

 BEAR THESIS on   LORDSTOWN MOTORS (4RIDE)

1) Lordstown Motors ability to continue as a company is a going concern. The possibility they may not get the additional funding required to ramp up the production phase of their operations. Worst case scenario: They could go bankrupt and this will result in hundreds of families in Lordstown, Ohio without work. However, the moment they say, ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù, this stock will triple.

2) Lordstown Motors future capital requirements; their ability to execute their business plan, and the risks related to the rollout of their business and the timing of expected release date for the Endurance. The Endurance is their all-electric full-size pick-up truck, the failure of this vehicle to launch successfully by the end of this year will be severely detrimental to the success of the company. **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year.**

3) Lordstown Motors ability to obtain binding purchase orders and build customer relationships, including uncertainties as to whether and to what degree we are able to convert previously-reported nonbinding pre-orders and other indications of interest in their vehicle into binding orders and ultimately sales. While companies like Ford and GM have a track record of succeeding in the fleet industry, Lordstown Motors is a new upcomer, and thus, this unknown variable causes a high degree of uncertainty.

4) Competition in the EV industry, from established veterans such as Ford, GM, and newcomers such as Rivian, Lucid, and others can‚Äôt be underestimated and understated. This is a serious threat to Lordstown Motors that cannot be ignored. Again, **Lordstown Motors must release the Endurance this year to get first mover advantage.**

1636044491.0,Tesla is valued fairly,"I think people misunderstand TSLA‚Äôs valuation. Every post that‚Äôs complaining and moaning about how crazy Tesla‚Äôs valuation is simply misses the most important points: 

1) it‚Äôs a subscription company. Tesla offers paid services in their cars. The premium connectivity package that cost $10 per month. With current production rate if 1 million EVs and 1.5 million next year, Tesla‚Äôs revenue will increase significantly not just through selling cars but also through the premium connectivity subscriptions. Moreover, the FSD capability is also going to be under the ‚Äòsubscription‚Äô model which will cost $199/month, according to electrek. 

(https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/?_gl=1*185lamx*_ga*YW1wLWZkZ01jdFNRT25KRXk4NjlYVjRLMEJUV2RPWDRkYjU4TG9tRDAyUDFZWWJ2RFVLT3NKRGlDeE1adklPZzlfc04.)

In technical terms, with estimated 40 million Teslas on the road by the end of this decade, that will add up to a shit ton of money that comes from software subscriptions. 

A good case scenario is this: (40,000,000) cars x ($210 monthly fee) x 12 months = shit ton of money/annual revenue. (Or $100.8 Billion annually.) 

2) it‚Äôs a utility company. Imagine being GM and owning most gas stations around the US. Tesla has the biggest and best charging network in the world that is only getting bigger and better. It is also opening up to other EVs which will have a subscription option or a higher one time payment option. And that already works today. 

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-hyundai-ioniq-mach-e-test-video/) 

Also, not to mention the actual utility business of solar and power wall, which papa Musk mentioned that it will be as big of a business as their car business. And we do see evidence of that too. 

( https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/) 

That being said, supply shortage is the biggest problem, but it‚Äôs just a matter of time before it is solved. 

3) It‚Äôs a Dojo company. The Dojo project is a mind blowing supercomputer which will be at the core of Tesla‚Äôs growth. The supercomputer that makes every Tesla the superior car. If there is a future with on demand robotaxis, it is one that as of now only Tesla is able to create. Monetary value will come in a form of subscriptions, licensing to other car makers, or direct to consumers. Either way, that by itself is worth a SHIT TON of money. 

4) it‚Äôs an Elon Musk company. Daddy Musk doesn‚Äôt fail - don‚Äôt bet against him. 

Conclusion: Tesla will be worth much more in the future and it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see that. You could probably double or triple your money with Tesla within 5 years even if you bought the stock today.

1612091171.0,Why $AMC over $BBBY?,"First of all let me pay my respects to the king $GME. Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.   


$BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.  


$GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC

Also that all that printed money has to find a home which basically flows into the stock market. I initially believed this narrative until I saw what bond yields were trading at and realized countries like Japan and much of Europe were doing QE for decades without hyperinflation. Here's a quick example of how QE works: bank buys 10 trillion of bonds from the treasury. They now have 10 trillion of bonds as assets on their books. The fed then buys those from the bank and the bank now has 10 trillion of reserves on it's balance sheet instead. Nothing really has changed since this is basically an asset swap and the bank could have sold those treauries on the open market if it needed cash as they tend to be quite liquid. Meanwhile the fed's balance sheet has increased by 10 trillion. 

Fast forward to late 2021 and the big banks are parking close to 2 trillion dollars at the federal reserve on a daily basis to earn interest on excess reserve. Basically what happened is the fed gave banks reserves and the banks in turn just parked those reserves at the fed instead of making new loans.

**Short Interest: 33mio shares (23% of float) -** covering of the shorts itself can shoot it to beyond the price targets!

Market cap: 10.7bn with 2021e revenues of \~$1.4bn

Morgan Stanley analyst: We view Sunrun as the most compelling clean energy stock they cover, driven by minimal growth reflected in the stock, a growing 'economic wedge', low financing costs, consumer demand for reliability and convergence of EVs & renewables.

The stock is reflecting \~6y of continued operation followed by zero customer additions - meaning Sunrun will go out of business after that, which is nuts!

The rapid growth of EVs adoption will be a major source of upside and can create as much value as existing set of customers.

Robinhood faced significant backlash, and in January 2022, they [announced they had lost a significant number users](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/27/robinhood-shares-tumble-9percent-after-first-quarter-revenue-forecast-is-well-below-estimates.html), shares rose 9.7% that day.

1684693038.0,How I Turned Market Volatility into a $375k Windfall: My VIX Trading Strategy Revealed! (With More Data and Enhanced Strategy!,"  I'm back with an even more detailed look at my VIX trading strategy that led me to $375,000 in profits. Thanks to your insightful comments, I've further refined my strategy and uncovered additional patterns from my dataset, which spans 16 years of market data. Let's dive deeper into the analysis and explore the enhanced strategy!

**The Data**

As a reminder, I analyzed 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data from 2005 to 2021. The dataset included:

¬∑ Daily VIX and SPX closing prices

¬∑ Gamma highs and lows

¬∑ 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages

¬∑ Moon phases (full moon and new moon dates)

**Key Insights and Revisions**

With your comments in mind, I revisited the dataset and discovered even more fascinating patterns that further strengthened my strategy:

1. From 2005 to 2021, on average, the VIX increased by 3.57% during new moons and decreased by 2.81% during full moons. This trend persisted across various market conditions and reinforced my decision to use moon phases in my trading strategy. As [u/5JeepHardRock](https://www.reddit.com/u/5JeepHardRock/) pointed out, full moons occur approximately every 29.5 days, which helped me better time my trades.

2. The inverse relationship between the VIX and SPX was particularly strong during significant market events. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX reached an all-time high of 80.86, while the SPX plummeted by more than 50%. This insight was crucial in helping me identify opportunities to short the SPX and buy VIX call options.

3. In the 16-year dataset, there were 27 instances where the Gamma spread was above 85. In 22 of these instances (81.48%), the VIX experienced a decline within the next 3 to 5 trading days, providing a perfect setup for my Thunder Call spreads.

4. Bullish markets saw an average VIX decline of 4.92% when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average. This pattern helped me time my Thunder Put trades to capitalize on potential market reversals.

5. As [u/Winter-Efficiency598](https://www.reddit.com/u/Winter-Efficiency598/) mentioned, I didn't make any significant gains in 2021. This is because the VIX was essentially flat during that year. However, I consider it a win, as my strategy helped me avoid unnecessary trades and potential losses in a volatile market.

**The Enhanced Strategy**

With the newfound insights and revisions, I've refined my initial strategy as follows:

1. During new moons, I shorted the SPX and bought VIX call options.

2. During full moons, I engaged in long puts on the VIX (Lightning Puts).

3. If a full moon occurred and the Gamma spread was 85 or higher, I entered a Thunder Call spread.

4. In bullish markets, I timed my Thunder Put trades to coincide with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

5. In periods of low VIX movement, such as 2021, I exercised patience and avoided unnecessary trades.

**Further Opportunities**

[u/Comicdn](https://www.reddit.com/u/Comicdn/) and [u/Affectionate\_Fix8401](https://www.reddit.com/u/Affectionate_Fix8401/) suggested that I could also explore potential squeeze/pump plays alongside my complex options trading. This is an excellent idea that could potentially boost my profits even further. I plan to delve into this area and share my findings with you all soon.

**Final Thoughts**

The more data you have, the better equipped you are to make informed trading decisions. By analyzing 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data, I was able to create a robust strategy that led me to a $375,000 profit. Your comments and feedback have been invaluable in refining and enhancing my approach.

Remember, investing is a journey of constant learning and adaptation. Be open to new ideas and strategies, and always strive to improve your understanding of the markets. Thank you all for your insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation and learning from each other.

Good luck, and happy trading!

P.S. As for the Jugo ETF idea from [u/Winter-Efficiency598](https://www.reddit.com/u/Winter-Efficiency598/), who knows? Maybe one day, we can all collaborate to launch it together.

Edit to the original post:

Update: Some people have mentioned that they think I'm joking because of the funny names I've used for my strategies. Let me clarify my approach.

To keep things straight, I come up with memorable names for my findings and then use data science to validate my hypotheses. If a hypothesis fails, I set it aside in case I can use a portion of it within another strategy or as a precursor. I like to think of strategies as switches in a house. You need to have multiple switches, but if they're all on, you're being wasteful. If you only have one on, you can't see clearly. The goal is to have a few on for the room you're in, setting the right vibe.

In other words, each strategy is not always engaged. They all have their own on/off switches and dimmers, as well as a master kill switch and a full-house surge protector. This approach allows me to adapt and optimize my trading strategies based on current market conditions.

Volatility is the only thing on earth that isn‚Äôt at it‚Äôs all time high. UVXY is where I am starting to allocate funds. Yes, it hurts in the pelvic region to hold that fund because of the decay, but we‚Äôre at an excellent entry point.

We are in a bona fide ‚Äúeverything bubble‚Äù brought on by extremely loose central bank policies across the globe. The market has simply melted upwards for the last year because of the implication that any negative market move will be attacked by the Fed. Combine that with ‚Äúvaccine optimism‚Äù and excitement about reopening, and you have people buying the promise that better times are coming. Now we‚Äôre reopened, so now what? Here are the risks we face:

1. Insane valuations - The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P just eclipsed Dot Com Bubble levels. 

2. Inflation. Whether you believe it‚Äôs transitory or not, it‚Äôs here, and it handcuffs how accommodative the Fed can be. The velocity of money brought on by reopening will only make it worse.

3. Stimulus expiration - 25 states have vowed to cut off boosted unemployment benefits in the next 30 days. Yes, there‚Äôs an abundance of jobs, but many will not be willing to work for less than what they were just receiving from the government. 

4. COVID- It‚Äôs not covered much by the media these days, but it‚Äôs still having a huge impact on other parts of the world. Additionally, new strains are out there which will be mobilized once travel resumes.

5. Tax Increases - Remember that concern we all heard about during election season? That‚Äôs still out there. Taxes will have to increase to pay for what the government just spent. Corporate and individual.

I fully expect to be called all sorts of names for being pessimistic on the market. Shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and the longer this melt-up continues the worse it will be. All I‚Äôm saying here is to remember that yes, risk does exist, and crashes happen.

The market has simply melted upwards for the last year because of the implication that any negative market move will be attacked by the Fed. Combine that with ‚Äúvaccine optimism‚Äù and excitement about reopening, and you have people buying the promise that better times are coming. Now we‚Äôre reopened, so now what? Here are the risks we face:

1. Insane valuations - The P/E ratio of the S&amp;P just eclipsed Dot Com Bubble levels. 

2. Inflation. Whether you believe it‚Äôs transitory or not, it‚Äôs here, and it handcuffs how accommodative the Fed can be. The velocity of money brought on by reopening will only make it worse.

3. Stimulus expiration - 25 states have vowed to cut off boosted unemployment benefits in the next 30 days. Yes, there‚Äôs an abundance of jobs, but many will not be willing to work for less than what they were just receiving from the government. 

4. COVID- It‚Äôs not covered much by the media these days, but it‚Äôs still having a huge impact on other parts of the world. Additionally, new strains are out there which will be mobilized once travel resumes.

5. Tax Increases - Remember that concern we all heard about during election season? That‚Äôs still out there. Taxes will have to increase to pay for what the government just spent. Corporate and individual.

I fully expect to be called all sorts of names for being pessimistic on the market. Shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and the longer this melt-up continues the worse it will be. All I‚Äôm saying here is to remember that yes, risk does exist, and crashes happen. 

**Don‚Äôt be afraid to NOT be retarded.**

I'm a retard who wants to make money, but I've been struggling to make good plays. It's been a fucking rollercoaster, so I decided this weekend I'd  devise a strategy to make sure I can still swim when everything inevitably goes sideways.

I know this is a casino, and the point is to accrue debt - all that fun stuff, but there are always good reasons to take a long position, and with how things have been going for people it is in fact a huge gamble, and it's not always clear when to exit. God forbid the swing happens while you're busy with something else and you lose out on not only profit but a big chunk of your money too.

**During a rise**
The most obvious way to cover yourself is just by buying calls or puts, depending on which is cheaper at the moment. After steady growth over some period of time puts will almost always be cheaper, and the puts you buy during this growth period might very well be more expensive than the stock you had in the first place if the stock tanks 30%. Even if you buy cheaper puts that don't completely cover you, you stand in a much better position to exit.

**Stagnant period after massive growth**
For some reason this is where people think they should buy in, but I assure you if you weren't there for the rise you're literally going to end up buying stock from degenerates who just got rich, your grandmother or a weed farmer. I suggest buying puts below the stock price and moving on to something else, but if you find yourself here with a long position after just getting a nice gain it's important to do one of a few things:

1) get out of there, what the fuck are you waiting for

2) sell everything and buy the calls and puts closest to the stock price

3) sell everything and gamble on one particular direction

4) did I mention to sell everything? I've been mentally compiling data on what happens after a price shoots up like 50% in a day, and I've come to a conclusion. DO NOT WRITE ANY FUCKING COVERED CALL POSITIONS. God, I fucking hate myself so much for this one... At least I got all that premium money, right?

I know all of these positions are pretty gay and bearish, but every one of these meme stocks seem to be overrun by people with amnesia. They looked at a green graph and said ""oh, gee, better buy 1000 calls before I miss out"". It's ridiculously easy to guess when something is completely overvalued, and you can make a lot of money like that too.

**On the other hand**
Alright, I know this is all obvious for many, and I'm probably just wasting my time writing this whole thing, but the opposite applies to falling markets. I already sort of mentioned this, but once the price seems to level off after a drop is when you could stand to make easy money off of uncertainty by just buying calls/puts near the current price. If you caught the stock at its ATH and loaded up on puts, then you probably don't care about this stock anymore and can finally move out of the basement.

1612702349.0,Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze,"Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that‚Äôs us) will pick the next one.

I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.

**The Company**

iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $3.50 for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.

So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?

Yeah, that‚Äôs right. Melvin is. Among others‚Ä¶  
 

**The Setup**

This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let‚Äôs talk about it.

There are 10.5 million shares sold short. That‚Äôs 37.6% of all shares outstanding. 

This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold 48.5% of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.

[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/irbt/ownership)

IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.

Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.

Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over. 

 I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I‚Äôm not recommending buying this stock. I‚Äôm also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast.

1611967136.0,Are we inadvertently blaming the wrong people?,"EDIT: I have been made aware RH is their own clearing house. If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

These last two days we‚Äôve seen insane backlash against RH, and, on the surface, for seemingly good reason: they restricted our ability to purchase GME among other shares, at a very important time! THEY SUPPRESSED RETAIL DEMAND DURING A SHORT SQUEEZE.

But I don‚Äôt think this was a decision they willingly made, nor do I think they made it in defense of the shorters (although it did inadvertently help them).

I‚Äôve read a few things, and correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken about any of them, that point to the clearing houses being responsible for RH‚Äôs inability to allow its customers to trade. The most recent evidence showcasing over 50+ shares that they‚Äôre restricting trading on, clearly indicates RH is experiencing a liquidity crisis. Why? Clearing houses increased RH‚Äôs margin requirements while conducting trades in their behalf. Not just RH‚Äôs, but many other brokers as well. 

When a trade is made, the clearing house is the intermediary. Let say you want to buy 1k of GME. RH takes your order, and gives it to the clearing house (it goes through citadel too but let‚Äôs ignore that for a moment) and the house finds a seller. They match you together, and the clearing house buys (with their own money) the share you want, gives it to you, and gets your money, but not right away. It typically processes for something around 2 days. They provide temporary liquidity to guarantee sellers get their funds immediately, and they require RH to also put up a portion of that temporary liquidity, as collateral (margin).

So what happened? The margin RH was required to put up increased from anywhere from 30% to 100%. That means if you buy 1k of shares, RH used to only need to show 300. Now they have to show 1k. And if they don‚Äôt, I assume they end up out of compliance, which leaves them liable to a lot of bad shit.

What happens if RH doesn‚Äôt have the liquidity to show 100% margin? They can‚Äôt take your trade, because they‚Äôd be out of compliance! So they reduce the amount of shares customers can buy to remain within liquidity margins. Same for other brokers as well. It seems really bad with RH however, because now they‚Äôve increased their reduced stock list to companies like Starbucks and GM. Wild. And with all the public backlash, customers are also probably trying to withdraw funds, causing a liquidity crisis feedback loop.

Now here‚Äôs the part that worries me, and again, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. RH innovated by allowing retail traders to trade for free, without fees. Their competition was forced to capitulate to these new standards. No fees, means easier trades for retail. Primarily, in the past, retail‚Äôs most common trade (and still probably today) were long term holds. If RH goes away, there‚Äôs a chance we see a reiteration of trading fees.

There‚Äôs also a chance we see more option restrictions on retail as well. The squeezes we‚Äôve been seeing happened, in part, because a purchase of an option causes the seller to go out and purchase shares to cover, in case the option is exercised. The relative price of purchasing an otm option is significantly less than of purchasing the underlying stock itself, but if many options are purchased, much of the stock gets purchased, and we see these types of gamma squeezes. RH enabled this. 

Anyways, positions are GME shares and calls, and of course: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ",wallstreetbets,"Are we inadvertently blaming the wrong people? EDIT: I have been made aware RH is their own clearing house. If so, then that shit's fucked and fuck them.

1) Supply Chain Bubble making production of goods near impossible and getting dire.  Lack of chips, energy and materials, transportation delays, worker shortage all coming to a head.  

2) Global financial deleveraging initiated by China's real estate debt crisis.  This isn't one or two companies.  This was policy and business strategy across the country.  Repercussions will be massive.

3) Money printing bubble...inflation and supply chain issues will weigh heavy on equity earnings.  Are assets overvalued beyond reason due to the money printing?  Will inflation reach hyperinflation or possibly a deflationary spiral at any taming of the printing presses.

OPTIONS.

That's why I sold half of my shares and bought FD(options expiring very soon) CALLS

Go to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) if you want to hold your fucking shares

We initially started to have explosive price actions at +$70 and $100.

That's because there was a fuckt ton of demand in OTM call options for GME. about 100k+ in OTM CALL options.

Don't know what gamma squeeze or options are? Let me give you a ELI5 version

Gamma squeeze = big money buying a shit ton of shares to cover their asses from selling call options to you.

Call options = you make x10 more of your money than holding shares but higher risks are involved.

Basically the more call options we hold the more MMs will have to buy up already dried up shares.

If you have no idea about options watch this video /watch?v=CRhGikRHSu8 and educate yourself. You will become very rich if you play it right.

 **Debt** 

Ford debt on their balance sheet that appears under long term debt heading is actually ‚ÄúNOT DEBT‚Äù that huge debt figure is the lending arm of Ford which essentially means:

1.  Ford lends people to buy cars and people pay them interest and principal over period of agreed terms. 

2.  This debt is the same as banks asset where in a bank makes money on interest payments Therefore, Debt in their balance sheet is long terms loans that ford made, and best part is in the high interest rate environment Ford is going to make more money in interest payments more than ever!!

&#x200B;

 **EV Strategy**

Ford Ev strategy is fierce and aggressive. Jim Farley understands that he needs to beat Tesla no matter what. He poached the best people from Tesla who have spent over a decade in tesla to ensure that Ford designs and builds better ev cars.  He is partnering with chip manufacturing firm Global foundries to get a better deal on chips. Surprisingly ford has partnered with Google in lot of skill building projects. It is possible that we may see a future partnership between google and ford for their EV software. Jim knows that they need a software partner to optimize their designs and builds. 

&#x200B;

**Previous Post** 

&#x200B;

¬∑  **Product Line**

Tesla have limited product line when it comes to EV‚Äôs, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. 

¬∑  **Margins**

Tesla‚Äôs biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin ‚Äì 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% 

Ford has lower margins (Gross ‚Äì 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that‚Äôs changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. 

¬∑  **Valuation & Market Share** 

The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford‚Äôs barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla‚Äôs revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That‚Äôs changing now!! 

Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that‚Äôs about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV‚Äôs 

¬∑  **Moat**

Tesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV‚Äôs and automation. With time and effort that‚Äôs diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV‚Äôs and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. 

¬∑  **Marketing**

Tesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!

¬∑  **High Interest rate Environment** 

We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. 

¬∑  **Team**

Last but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership.

And now, the first good news Lordstown has had in months:

https://www.investors.com/news/ride-stock-lordstown-motors-discloses-400-million-equity-deal/

This funding deal (which is optional to Lordstown) will encourage others to follow and also encourage their pending AVTM loan. The stock spiked in the morning and ended the day in red with 3x normal volume.

This is the inflection point for Lordstown. Fraudulent management is out, they affirmed they have cash to operate until mid 2022 (even without this funding) and have affirmed production in September several times.

Catalysts to follow this initial good news:
-AVTM loan
-New CEO
-Production commencement in Sept.
-Projected sales figures

This is a real truck that has passed safety tests and a real factory that is tooled up. Previous management sucked and sunk the stock price into the dirt. There are some lawsuits over some phony preorders that they‚Äôll have to pay fines for‚Ä¶ which every EV SPAC is subject to in one way or another.

Short interest is high and it‚Äôs primed for a decent squeeze. This is like NKLA, but they actually have a truck and a factory.

Production will be in September. Made in America. A true underdog story happening in a rural Ohio town that needs the jobs badly‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôve been on a hiring spree.

CNBC+Cramer hate this stock. Media hates this stock. Ford hates this company. Shitty+crooked previous management+media hate has created tremendous value and a prime candidate for a nice squeeze.

I don‚Äôt love the truck and I actually ordered a Cybertruck the day it was revealed. BUT‚Ä¶ this company will pull through and it‚Äôll be the first full-size EV truck on the road. This $7 stock will return to the $20‚Äôs and possibly more, by EOY.

1612278572.0,"Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff","# Disclaimer:

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let‚Äôs brake some things down:

SILVER:

It‚Äôs   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn‚Äôt screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn‚Äôt find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: ‚ÄúWhat's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you‚Äù ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) ‚Äúfearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.‚Äù I‚Äôm an autist, I don‚Äôt feel fearful at all. I simply can‚Äôt‚Ä¶   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It‚Äôs basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value.

But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real **game changer**!

Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let‚Äôs  bring it to the crucial point first:

Look for **information asymmetries**,   google it or whatever‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about in the end. That‚Äôs   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It‚Äôs all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly‚Ä¶ however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it‚Äôs even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)

So, lets come back to the bullet point:

Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind. ...the whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.

But   hey, I‚Äôm just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I‚Äôm  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.

TL;DR: GME, trillions, to the moon!",wallstreetbets,"Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff # Disclaimer:

I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.

Okay fellow retards,

loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let‚Äôs brake some things down:

SILVER:

It‚Äôs   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn‚Äôt screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.

Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn‚Äôt find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like **smart money is not buying the silver rush**.

&#x200B;

ANTI GME  BOTS:

These guys are getting their **bots more and more angry and aggressive**   over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: ‚ÄúWhat's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you‚Äù ...I hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!

Anyways... just to repeat **the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards** and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!

To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) ‚Äúfearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.‚Äù I‚Äôm an autist, I don‚Äôt feel fearful at all. I simply can‚Äôt‚Ä¶   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.

&#x200B;

SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:

So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate **SI rates**. It‚Äôs basically **still \~120%**.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read\_this\_they\_are\_screwed\_numbers\_dont\_lie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

In science you would say they normalized the standardization:

You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different‚Ä¶ Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):

RC sold when the stock is climbing and it didn't made a dent to the rise. 

It begins to fall only the report of his intention to sell comes out.

Short interest is still high yesterday even when he sold all of his stake. So buying a heavy shorted stock is likely gonna net profit.

1668211338.0,You‚Äôre all a bunch of sheep,"*Short term noise*

A stock falls 5% and everyone screams to buy the dip like a Tostitos salesman, but during a bear market everyone thinks the world is ending. $TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it‚Äôs causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it‚Äôs short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it‚Äôs stress maybe he‚Äôs actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I‚Äôll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that‚Äôs actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm debating here. 

*‚ÄùDD‚Äù*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I‚Äôm sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it‚Äôs also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That‚Äôs ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don‚Äôt look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it‚Äôs not effecting sales but regardless it‚Äôs getting better and it‚Äôs actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you‚Äôre delusional, it‚Äôs just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from ‚Äúluxury‚Äù but it‚Äôs durable and practical. For $50k it‚Äôs understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it‚Äôs unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don‚Äôt see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They‚Äôre earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we‚Äôll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. ‚ÄúSome years will be a little less some will be a little more.‚Äù Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don‚Äôt need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won‚Äôt be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it‚Äôs worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who‚Äôs going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They‚Äôre moving into Europe, I don‚Äôt see them moving to North American markets soon. It‚Äôs very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they‚Äôre growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I‚Äôd buy their stock if they weren‚Äôt IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven‚Äôt even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn‚Äôt include  FSD because it‚Äôs not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don‚Äôt consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

Thanks for listening to my TED talk, ik reading is hard. Oh and sorry my bad üò©üöÄüöÄüìà

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

1635956815.0,All in on Meta,"I‚Äôll cut to the chase. I‚Äôm all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I don‚Äôt care if they use ‚Äúunethical‚Äù targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was ‚Äúfacebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz‚Äù. The government was like ‚Äúyes this is a grave matter indeed.‚Äù They won‚Äôt do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebook‚Äôs reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But that‚Äôs the boring shit. I really don‚Äôt care about that. After all, I‚Äôm ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. It‚Äôs going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. I‚Äôm about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but I‚Äôm not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** It‚Äôs already happening and it‚Äôs accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and it‚Äôs starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moore‚Äôs law to the computer chip. It‚Äôs been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if it‚Äôs lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? I‚Äôm not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, it‚Äôs the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then you‚Äôll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, I‚Äôll show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins aren‚Äôt just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like you‚Äôve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it won‚Äôt stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta won‚Äôt tell you about the metaverse: By the time you‚Äôve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living.  In your headset, Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow that‚Äôs scary and really good for targeted advertising. And you‚Äôd be right. But that‚Äôs just the beginning.
   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things you‚Äôll want to buy, experiences you‚Äôll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends won‚Äôt be homo sapiens. They‚Äôll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *that‚Äôs stupid this is stupid I‚Äôm never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when you‚Äôre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that it‚Äôs a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you.
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If they‚Äôve had billions of years to evolve, why don‚Äôt we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? It‚Äôs not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt it‚Äôs that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to.

Meta is a company paving the way to redefine the human species, to redefine existence, and to redefine our future. Meta will own the platform upon which our lives exist. This world is terrifying, strange, unbelievable, but also inevitable. And it will be beautiful. It may sound dystopian, but it is, in fact, the opposite. To exist as pure data in the metaverse is the end of death. It is the end of hunger. It is the end of humanity as we know it. On October 28th, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and announced itself as a company fully dedicated to the metaverse. A day that will go in the history books as a turning point and the beginning of the new age. The world is changing, and it will only change more and more rapidly. The end is approaching, and so is the beginning. And I‚Äôm ready to be a part of it.

EDIT:

tl;dr: 

\-VR is exploding exponentially

\-Meta is fundamentally undervalued right now even just as FB with out VR

\-Computing power is progressing exponentially which will enable absurd VR potential

\-A separate metaverse economy will explode like the gold rush and snowball to overtake the GDP of the real world over the next several decades

\-VR headsets will take your data and render and AI that can sell you things you didn't know you wanted

\-You will fall in love with an AI generated from your data consciousness model

\-VR is the solution to the Fermi Paradox",wallstreetbets,"All in on Meta I‚Äôll cut to the chase. I‚Äôm all in on meta. Here is why:

Firstly, Meta is outrageously undervalued in its current state. I don‚Äôt care if they use ‚Äúunethical‚Äù targeted ads. Use your data to sell me things. I watched the entire whistleblower hearing and it was silly. Not only was she unable to provide specific documents, but her strongest argument was ‚Äúfacebook bad because it makes people feel bad. Government help plz‚Äù. The government was like ‚Äúyes this is a grave matter indeed.‚Äù They won‚Äôt do anything. The public will stop caring. In a month this will blow over into the dustbin of facebook‚Äôs reputation and the stock will naturally ascend back to the p/e they deserve. If you give them a p/e of 30. The stock will sit right around $400 (current p/e 23).

But that‚Äôs the boring shit. I really don‚Äôt care about that. After all, I‚Äôm ALL IN on this company. The metaverse is not a silly sci-fi idea. It‚Äôs going to be real very soon, it will accelerate faster than you can imagine, and it will replace reality as you know it. I‚Äôm about to explain exactly where this is going in the near future and the distant future. This is going to sound very dystopian, which I agree with, but I‚Äôm not in the stock market to be moral.

**The VR explosion:** It‚Äôs already happening and it‚Äôs accelerating. 4 years ago, VR was a silly thing. Maybe you had one friend with a headset and they had like a few games or whatever. 2 years ago VR was a niche market. With the release of the Oculus quest 1, more people could afford and choose to purchase a headset. But with the quest 2 and the way things are playing out today, many of my friends have VR. And owning a VR headset is no longer a crazy thing and it‚Äôs starting to become the norm. In 2020 steam VR saw an increase in user base by 30% and an increase in revenue by 71%. The oculus quest 2 has sold 8 million destroying the sales of the quest 1 by a nearly 700% increase. If this trend is set to continue. The next VR release from Meta, Project Cambria, will sell 700% of 8 million which would be 56 million headsets by 2023.

**VR technology is growing exponentially:** VR and especially AR is predicated on the ability to fit powerful computers inside of small spaces. Applying Moore‚Äôs law to the computer chip. It‚Äôs been a well observed reality that computing power doubles every year. Meaning you can fit twice the amount of processing power within the same volume every year. Think about that- *All computing progress developed by humanity over the course if it‚Äôs lifetime is doubled YEARLY.* The development of face and eye tracking is set to be released on a consumer priced Meta VR headset in mid 2022. Visuals are approaching human eye resolution, and VR is still in its infancy.

Okay, enough about current data. Where is this really going? I‚Äôm not sold on it, it seems kinda dumb.

**The crazy shit:** The metaverse is not the successor to the internet, it‚Äôs the successor to reality. Within the decade we will see the metaverse really take shape, then you‚Äôll begin to see the vision of where this is going with your own eyes. But if you want a preview, I‚Äôll show you.

1. The metaverse will be an exponential self-sustaining economy that will surpass the GDP of the entire world. Think of transactions in the metaverse for gaming, like CSGO skins. The skins are represented as NFTs. And are traded on the market. Your skins aren‚Äôt just for your game though. The metaverse is all connected, and you can take your CSGO skin and use it as an item in another game. You can take your genji skin and go to a concert. At the concert the person might sell T-shirts specific to that event which are also represented as NFTs. Businesses will begin to pop up in the metaverse. I already have several ideas, but will not be disclosing them here. Once people realize how easy it is to make money in the metaverse, much like the internet, there will be a mass migration. A gold rush like you‚Äôve never seen. I could easily see another dot-com bubble level of excitement. The economy will rapidly grow. And as the metaverse becomes more and more real, it will only accelerate that growth. As more people join the metaverse, more major companies will need to change their business model to enter the metaverse in order to survive. Which will be a feedback loop that grows to unimaginable heights. If you want to get rich, be an early metaverse adopter and start a company that sells a service or product specifically useful for the metaverse. The real economy will transition more and more to the virtual and there will come a day before 2040 when the GDP of the metaverse surpasses that of the real world. And it won‚Äôt stop there. Whoever runs the metaverse will have an economy larger than the entire world under their thumb.
2. What Meta won‚Äôt tell you about the metaverse: By the time you‚Äôve normalized living in the metaverse, you better not care about privacy anymore. I believe the idea of privacy will ultimately be discarded as the price of living.  In your headset, Meta will track your eye movements, your facial expressions, the way your body physically responds to the sensory input of the virtual world. Whether you like it or not, you are a predictable genetic algorithm. And when billions of data points about your response to input are measured, Meta will be able to build an artificial model of your expected output and know what you want before you want it. You might think, wow that‚Äôs scary and really good for targeted advertising. And you‚Äôd be right. But that‚Äôs just the beginning.
   1. Further future- 2030-2050: Once your being is analyzed as a data model (By an AI like a more powerful version of youtube recommended). At this point in time, AI has reached unprecedented capabilities. AI will build entire worlds for you, filled with things it knows you will enjoy, things you‚Äôll want to buy, experiences you‚Äôll want to have. A world far more interesting and exciting than the real one, tailored specifically to you.
   2. But your data will construct something even more bizarre. AI NPCs. Your best friends won‚Äôt be homo sapiens. They‚Äôll be AI indistinguishable from real people. Perhaps even alive themselves. Generated based on the data of your predictable personality model. Your true love. Someone literally perfect for you, will be an AI. And it will be incredible. You might think, *that‚Äôs stupid this is stupid I‚Äôm never going to fall in love with an AI*. You are wrong. And when you‚Äôre there and the entity is in front of you in the virtual world. When you can touch them, and they can express emotion to you, you will understand. Your utopia is coming.
3. The metaverse will change what it means to be human. It will redefine our understanding of humanity and even gender. In the virtual world, there is no need to be a human. Your avatar can be an animal, a robot, an amoeba, an anime character, literally anything. People will soon feel better represented by your avatar than your real self. And as we cross that threshold the real world will seem more and more lack luster. The real world becomes a boring place where you have to live with this boring body that has to obey the laws of physics. This will further push the transition to the virtual world.
4. The transition from sedentary VR living to immortal consciousness. As people realize how incredible it is to live in the metaverse, the race for immortality will break out more powerfully than the space race. What is the race for immortality? It means to exist as pure data. To upload your consciousness into the metaverse directly, to abandon your feeble human body and live forever exploring the virtual world filled with real people and AI. The ever changing and evolving economy and ecosystem. To travel from universe as you please. If Meta is a part of this transition, then they will own the platform on which your mind exists. They will literally own your body in a sense. Privacy will be so far gone that it‚Äôs a wistful wish of the past, nor will you likely care. Meta will see everything, will know everything you are, everything you could ever want. And they will sell it to you.
5. The Fermi paradox: where are all the aliens? If there are so many worlds capable of supporting life, if there are quadrillions of planets in the galaxy. If they‚Äôve had billions of years to evolve, why don‚Äôt we see signs of intelligent life in the universe? Why are we alone out here? It‚Äôs not that intelligent life inherently drives itself to extinction. I highly doubt it‚Äôs that intelligent life is so absurdly rare that we are the only ones. The solution to the Fermi paradox is that there is no reason to ever travel beyond the solar system. A civilization capable of interstellar travel is capable of creating its own universe- unbound by the laws of physics and the vast distances between the stars. A civilization that can shape reality like gods through the virtual world. To exist as pure data consciousness in a network of supercomputers. Humanity will never travel beyond the solar system, not because we will go extinct, but because we will never need to.

In the last two days, Cathie Wood added over 6 million shares across ARKK and ARKW, her biggest purchase by far. Technically speaking, SKLZ looks to be in a reversal path and the risk reward scenario is highly favorable. This company can honestly grow in huge multiples in the next 5 years and beyond. I see the price here being over $200 by end of 2023. 

DD:

1. SKLZ has 95% profit margins. Yes.... NINETY FIVE %. Although they are not profitable yet (they reinvest all profits into marketing efforts for growth), when they do become profitable, expected in 2022, the profits will grow wildly. They are debt free and have 600 million on their balance sheet however. 

2. SKLZ is a platform provider for betting between users who play Mobile games, the fastest growing gaming market. Think of SKLZ as the Shopify of gaming. $SHOP provides a platform to small e-commerce outfits whereas SKLZ provides a platform to the small game developers. SHOP was $10/share just 5 years ago. The mobile market is expected to double in the next 4 years. 

3. The US is only 10% of the worlds mobile gaming market, and SKLZ is in process of expanding to India this year. They have included the costs of India expansion into projections, but none of the projected revenues. India is a larger market and growing at a much faster rate. This could literally double revenues by next year. 

4.

Essentially, people would verse each other on their bikes. This would make it more fun and add a betting element. This partnership would be HUGE. 

5. SKLZ already has a partnership with the NFL for a developer to make a football-themed SKLZ app this year. They can easily make partnerships with the remaining sports organizations. SKLZ also intends to expand into first person shooters and racing games this year.

Despite what many people who have a vested interest in this succeeding are telling you, a price increase to 800$ is not **certain.** A lot of shorts have already been and are being covered right now.

While I am sure that the short interest right now is still very high, because this seems like free money to most hedgefunds a further price increase is not certain at all at these levels. Im confident that 90% of shares shorted at 40-90$ have already been squeezed out, causing the massive price increases to $340. The only way another short squeeze happens is if some insitution decides to make it happen by playing the long side and squeezing out the shares reshorted at 200-300$, but this would be very hard, since the price is already so high.

1618690626.0,Extremely thorough CLOV recent action DD,"I‚Äôm going to go back a little bit in time and tell you how CLOV was directly related to GME squeeze.
So when GME was squeezing two very influential people have backed the squeeze and caused it to squeeze even more. Those two people were Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya. Both partners in previous endeavors and friends. 
GME squeeze hurt short seller Hindenburg so much that they have lost 40% of their account that week. 
CLOV is backed by Chamath Palihapitiya. Hindenburg, in order to retaliate at Chamath for causing them huge losses, published a short seller report for CLOV few days after Chamath tweeted about GME. Short seller report had very little base, yet that caused the stock to drop and also SEC had to initiate an investigation due to the claims. 
Since then stock got beaten down to less than IPO prices. What does that mean? It means that it was moved not so much by true owners of the stock, but mostly by short sellers. That will play in nicely in the squeeze because short sellers always have to close out, but if stock is still held by their true purchasers it means that there are even less shares available for active trading. 



Enough of history. Retail following:

Since GME endeavor Chamath PAlihapitiya joined the club of ‚Äúretail gods‚Äù.... he is one of the poster babies for retail movement on hurting short sellers. His previous partnerships with Elon Musk furthers retail following so now not only we have GME crowd supporting Chamath, but also Tesla crowd. Both of those stocks were some of the most successful trades in history. 



Friday‚Äôs Hindenburg‚Äôs fright with CLOV:

On Friday CLOV has opened with 148% short interest and after this was noticed by retail the squeeze has started. The volume topped 250M shares traded (10x average daily volume and 5x its previous heaviest volume day). (Ill get in to more technicals later, but needed to mention this to push the narrative).
Hindenburg saw the action and protecting their possible short position tweeted that FactSet has misleading short interest data about CLOV not including CEOs clad B shares in the float. 
FactSet came back to Hindenburg‚Äôs allegations with a reply that CEOs type B shares are classified as not tradable and are not included in the float. And once again confirmed that stock is 148% short.
This further angered retail traders and a lot of chatter online has started how Hindenburg is trying to manipulate this stock with lies and deceit. 
A lot of people didn‚Äôt catch on on Friday but through the night and this afternoon Reddit and stock twits seem to have exploded about it, videos are popping up on YouTube. A lot of traction is being created over the weekend for a sweet Monday open. 



Technicals:
*CLOV free float is 109mil 
*CLOV shares outstanding are 406mil
*78% of CLOV shares are owed by insiders and are still locked up. Insiders are only allowed to sell if stock hits $30 and stays above $30 for 90 days 
*institutional ownership of CLOV is at 48%

*the volume on Friday was 249mil shares which only represents 61% turn over for shares outstanding, but if you take locked up shares out of consideration, true turn over was actually 228%, meaning every share available to trade was bought and sold at least twice on Friday. 

A lot of people that bought on Friday (including NEXT financial group that bought 21,400 shares) will not likely be actively trading this week meaning available shares short term will continue on decreasing.

In my speculation out of 109 mil free float Only around 35% of shares will be available to trade this week. Here is how I got to this number: 
-institutions owe 48% of stock and they are not likely to trade short term fluctuations, but giving it a benefit of doubt let‚Äôs say that institutions that will hold account only to 30% of float. Now we only have 70% of float left to trade....
-let‚Äôs assume that investors that owe CLOV long term account for 20% of the float. A lot of them don‚Äôt check stocks daily or sometimes even weekly. Let‚Äôs assume that half of them even won‚Äôt notice what is happening this week. At this point we only have 50% of float left to trade. 
-the rest of the free float is being traded by scalpers/ day traders, swing traders and ‚Äúdiamond handers‚Äù. This is a very educated group and unless scalping or pattern trading will understand that we are in the middle of the squeeze and hold. I believe this group will contribute to another 15% of float being unavailable, assuming half of them will be trading fluctuations and half holding. 
So my conclusion is: only 35% of available shares will be circulating next week being sold and bought over and over again. That‚Äôs only 38mil shares not being stuck in someone‚Äôs account semi permanently. Some more liquidity will be provided short term by other shorters flocking in, but I won‚Äôt take them in consideration because they too have to close out at some point. 

Fallowing all this speculative, yet very carefully vetted math let‚Äôs calculate the demand for the shares, just to close short positions
-148% of the free float is shorted, meaning 161mil shares will be in demand just to close out short positions. Since we already established that there will be only 38mil shares freely circulating in the market each short share will only have 0.24 shares. So looks like there are 4 times less shares than demand to close short positions! Throw in some buying activity to that math and you have a number closer to 10:1. 

Following all of that the question is how far the stock can go during this particular squeeze? Well the answer is: it‚Äôs mathematically impossible to calculate. Although there are some indicators of what people can expect. Smaller the float, the bigger the short interest and the heavier the volume the further it can go. In this particular instance we have the combination of all three factors. Even if it‚Äôs impossible to predict exactly what price short squeeze will hit, it‚Äôs possible to trade short squeeze well using technical indicators and trade management. Monitoring volume, daily short interest and days to cover should be adequate. To know when short squeeze is ending I monitor same indicators that made me spot the short squeeze to start with, but in reverse. Meaning volume will start to tapper off, short percentage decrease and the upwards momentum will start to whilt. I also watch out for extremely sudden, needle like falls (trailing stop loss domino effect). 

I hope the read was interesting and I haven‚Äôt lost you half way through.

Basically looking at 100% covering if it holds $13 which would 3-5x the price (again) because the open interest supersedes the amount of shares available, which puts it in contention for an infinite squeeze. 500% cost to borrow.. highest in the whole market. I don't think I've ever seen a stock be negative for this many consecutive days without a rebound. Seems shady. I always wanted to achieve the opposite of a short ladder attack, which is **the bulldoze attack**.

**Guide to setting up high frequency trading on WSB:** On any low float stock, if a large group of buyers, purchase 1 share per order and repeats that 50-100 times, we could utilize our version of high frequency trading to raise the price of a stock. The reverse would be a short ladder tactic to regress the price with high frequency selling. This would essentially be it's counter. The caveat is Robinhood, and using their payment for order flow utilization to game the system in our favor. (Ever wonder why when you submit an order to buy anything on robinhood at market price (without setting a limit $ value) your immediately negative once the order is filled?) It's because there is an intermediary using your bid to buy at the lowest offer from a seller first.. just before re-selling it to you after at a slightly higher premium price per share (skimming). Instead of getting the best price at market value at the time of your order in good faith, you have a sleazy middleman milking you for every share. And we buy in the thousands so skimming .0023 on 4500 shares is still a cost of $10.35 to us, under the guise of ""free trading utopia for all"". (Yes, there is an investigation on going currently into Robinhood about this, so let's bury our head in the sand and keep our fingers crossed) Anyway, we could instead leverage this 3rd party to essentially be upping the price for us on every buy order we submit at market value because... each buy request we submit is automatically doubled in frequency with the price slightly increasing per order filled... This would essentially be our manual version of using high frequency trading to level the playing field on low volume / volatile stocks. I have experimented this on $KMPH a low float stock with a few friends and have seen the movement like clockwork but it required us buying 5 shares per order, non-stop at market value without setting a purchase price $ limit (did this about 100 times repeatedly). This only works in the time of WSB because we have strength in numbers and community sentiment during this state of constant battle with coordinated hedgefund attacks on meme rallies. So our focus should shift to optimizing the community buying strategy and develop counter strategies to the tactics used to dismantle stocks mid rally.

In summary: **This is a low float stock, remarkably easy to rally, with a sharp catalyst this particular week to 3x it.**

I think this the type of swing trade folks here have a taste for. I see DD's on $CRSR, about it's long-term deep future projections and touting a low float of 36.32 million. This one has 4 million... Running a stock that trades 1 mil volume per day is much easier achieved than even the current squeezes in play like $PROG (26.44 million float) or $SOFI (614 million float).

To be noted: I don't mind punishing market makers (aka hedgefunds) for greedily overextending their risk on a derivative trade by offering calls exceeding the share count of the stock. Poor risk management has it's consequences.

1602364581.0,Tesla calls bought me a tesla...,"It was a cold January morning. Tesla was up about 15% in the past few days. I hadn‚Äôt bought the stock before, but was intrigued by the business model and being an investing rookie, I felt some FOMO. I bought 2 shares. A few weeks later I sold out at a $400 dollar profit. If only I had known them what I know now... little did I know, that this quick little stock flip would be the beginning of the next chapter of my life.

I repeated the process a few times until the corona dip. At this point I had consistent $ coming in from an ECom business I was running. I put it ALL IN TESLA. The rest of my portfolio has tanked but when Tesla turned around, it brought the whole thing back upwards. I was hooked. Elon had won me over. I was officially a Tesla tard.

Then, in June, I discovered options üòà. I made had a few losses and a few wins. Notably, a Spotify option play that made me around 15k. I made a mistake and sold a call on Tesla right before a run up. It was exercised. Even though I didn‚Äôt lose money, I was heartbroken. My position in Tesla was cut in half. 

While I could just buy back in at a higher price, I decided to make a BIG BET. I was confident on Tesla in the long term and I had about $97,000 in cash in my account from the call being exercised. I went ALL in on a Tesla 9/18 call. The very next day, the stock rifled up giving me a 50k profit on the day.

If investing into stocks was like cocaine, I had now found crack. And god I loved it.

Elon Musk‚Äôs Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla     

Ira Boudway and Kyle Stock           

Sat, July 30, 2022 at 9:00 AM           

(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Levitt got his first Tesla, a blue Model S, in 2013, and loved it. ‚ÄúIt was so much better than any car I've ever driven,‚Äù the 73-year-old self-storage company executive says.        

He bought into the brand as well as Elon Musk, Tesla Inc.‚Äôs charismatic chief executive officer, purchasing another Model S the following year and driving the first one across the country. In 2016, he stood in line at a showroom near his suburban Los Angeles home to be one of the first to order two Model 3s ‚Äî one for himself, the other for his wife.

‚ÄúI was a total Musk fanboy,‚Äù Levitt says.

Was, because while Levitt still loves his Teslas, he‚Äôs soured on Musk. ‚ÄúOver time, his public statements have really come to bother me,‚Äù Levitt said, citing the CEO‚Äôs spats with US President Joe Biden, among others. ‚ÄúHe acts like a seven-year-old.‚Äù

Before it was reported Musk had an affair with Sergey Brin‚Äôs wife, which he‚Äôs denied; before his slipshod deal, then no-deal, to acquire Twitter Inc.; before the revelation he fathered twins with an executive at his brain-interface startup Neuralink; before SpaceX fired employees who called him ‚Äúa frequent source of distraction and embarrassment‚Äù; before his daughter changed her name and legal gender after his history of mocking pronouns; before an article said SpaceX paid an employee $250,000 to settle a claim he sexually harassed her, allegations he‚Äôs called untrue; Musk‚Äôs behavior was putting off prospective customers and perturbing some Tesla owners.

The trends have shown up in one consumer survey and market research report after another: Tesla commands high brand awareness, consideration and loyalty, and customers are mostly delighted by its cars. Musk‚Äôs antics, on the other hand? They could do without.

Creative Strategies, a California-based customer-experience measurer, mentioned owner frustration with Musk in a study it published in April. A year earlier, research firm Escalent found Musk was the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among electric-vehicle owners surveyed.

‚ÄúWe hear from Tesla owners who will say, ‚ÄòLook, I love my vehicle, but I really wish I didn't have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet,‚Äô‚Äù says Mike Dovorany, who spoke with thousands of EV owners and potential buyers during his two years working in Escalent‚Äôs automotive and mobility group.

Tesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through Musk‚Äôs many controversies. The dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with Covid lockdowns in Shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks. Competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the EV sales ranks.

Musk‚Äôs star power, built in no small part by his activity on Twitter ‚Äî the same forum where he‚Äôs become such a lightning rod ‚Äî has contributed immensely to Tesla, especially since it‚Äôs shunned traditional advertising. His steady stream of online banter, punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt (see: shooting a Roadster into space) keeps Tesla in the headlines. During the company‚Äôs earlier days, the trolling and glib comments were a feature, not a bug. They allowed Musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for Tesla‚Äôs legion of very-online fans.

But after making Tesla and himself so synonymous with one another, Musk has waded into political conflicts, attempted to buy one of the world‚Äôs most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life, putting the company‚Äôs increasingly valuable brand at risk.

Stay on top of the electric car revolution by signing up to our Hyperdrive newsletter here.

Jerry James Stone, a 48-year-old chef in Sacramento, California, who teaches his 219,000 YouTube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals, drives a Volkswagen Beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car. He isn‚Äôt sure yet which model, but certain it won‚Äôt be a Tesla.

‚ÄúElon has just soiled that brand for me so much that I don't even think I would take one if I won one,‚Äù Stone says. ‚ÄúYou have this guy who's the richest dude in the world, who has this huge megaphone, and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who's not, or to fat-shame people, all these things that are just kind of gross.‚Äù

According to Strategic Vision, a US research firm that consults auto companies, some 39% of car buyers say they wouldn‚Äôt consider a Tesla. That‚Äôs not necessarily out of the ordinary ‚Äî almost half of respondents say they won‚Äôt consider German luxury brands. But Tesla does lag more mass-market brands: Toyota, for example, is only off the shopping list for 23% of drivers.

Emma Sirr, a 28-year-old worker in cloud computing who lives in Bozeman, Montana, gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. They've been researching EVs for about three years and until recently considered Teslas the only viable option, given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area. But they refused to buy one because of Musk, their main gripes being his politics, staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomous-driving technology.

‚ÄúWe took Tesla off the table from the get-go,‚Äù Sirr says. She and her partner have their eyes on the Kia Niro and Chevrolet Bolt as possible alternatives. ‚ÄúAs consumers, our power is what we buy. I think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets, and I feel like that might come back to bite.‚Äù

For much of the past decade, Tesla lacked competitors that matched its models‚Äô battery range and other measures of performance. Consumers put off by Musk‚Äôs mischief had few EVs to turn to. As legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models, Tesla won‚Äôt have as much leeway.

‚ÄúWe've seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary,‚Äù says Dovorany, who left Escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year. ‚ÄúWe're not seeing that as much with incoming buyers.‚Äù To win this cohort, automakers need to check every box, and for some, that includes employing a CEO who doesn‚Äôt share Hilter memes on social media.

Levitt, the self-described former Musk fanboy, took a test ride last month in a Lucid. He wasn‚Äôt sold on it, partly he says because it didn‚Äôt have enough cargo space for his golf gear. He‚Äôs still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from Tesla and considering models from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.

‚ÄúIf you take Mr. Musk and his antics out of the equation, I'm about 98% certain that my next car would be a Tesla,‚Äù Levitt says. ‚ÄúHis antics put me in play.‚Äù",wallstreetbets,"$TSLA | Elon Musk‚Äôs Antics Turn Owners and Would-Be Buyers Against Tesla https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-antics-turn-owners-130031862.html

Creative Strategies, a California-based customer-experience measurer, mentioned owner frustration with Musk in a study it published in April. A year earlier, research firm Escalent found Musk was the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand among electric-vehicle owners surveyed.

‚ÄúWe hear from Tesla owners who will say, ‚ÄòLook, I love my vehicle, but I really wish I didn't have to respond to my friends and family about his latest tweet,‚Äô‚Äù says Mike Dovorany, who spoke with thousands of EV owners and potential buyers during his two years working in Escalent‚Äôs automotive and mobility group.

Tesla has so far had no trouble growing its way through Musk‚Äôs many controversies. The dip in vehicle deliveries the company reported last quarter was its first sequential decline since early 2020 and largely had to do with Covid lockdowns in Shanghai forcing its most productive factory to shut for weeks. Competitors that have been chasing the company for a decade may still be years away from catching up in the EV sales ranks.

Musk‚Äôs star power, built in no small part by his activity on Twitter ‚Äî the same forum where he‚Äôs become such a lightning rod ‚Äî has contributed immensely to Tesla, especially since it‚Äôs shunned traditional advertising. His steady stream of online banter, punctuated with the occasional grandiose announcement or stunt (see: shooting a Roadster into space) keeps Tesla in the headlines. During the company‚Äôs earlier days, the trolling and glib comments were a feature, not a bug. They allowed Musk to shape media coverage and made him the ringleader for Tesla‚Äôs legion of very-online fans.

But after making Tesla and himself so synonymous with one another, Musk has waded into political conflicts, attempted to buy one of the world‚Äôs most influential social media platforms and struggled to bat back unflattering coverage of his personal life, putting the company‚Äôs increasingly valuable brand at risk.

Jerry James Stone, a 48-year-old chef in Sacramento, California, who teaches his 219,000 YouTube channel subscribers how to make vegan and vegetarian meals, drives a Volkswagen Beetle convertible and plans to go electric with his next car. He isn‚Äôt sure yet which model, but certain it won‚Äôt be a Tesla.

‚ÄúElon has just soiled that brand for me so much that I don't even think I would take one if I won one,‚Äù Stone says. ‚ÄúYou have this guy who's the richest dude in the world, who has this huge megaphone, and he uses it to call somebody a pedophile who's not, or to fat-shame people, all these things that are just kind of gross.‚Äù

According to Strategic Vision, a US research firm that consults auto companies, some 39% of car buyers say they wouldn‚Äôt consider a Tesla. That‚Äôs not necessarily out of the ordinary ‚Äî almost half of respondents say they won‚Äôt consider German luxury brands. But Tesla does lag more mass-market brands: Toyota, for example, is only off the shopping list for 23% of drivers.

Emma Sirr, a 28-year-old worker in cloud computing who lives in Bozeman, Montana, gets around with her partner and their two dogs in a 2004 Nissan Frontier. They've been researching EVs for about three years and until recently considered Teslas the only viable option, given their range and the charging infrastructure the company has built in their area. But they refused to buy one because of Musk, their main gripes being his politics, staff turnover at the company and its cavalier approach to autonomous-driving technology.

‚ÄúWe took Tesla off the table from the get-go,‚Äù Sirr says. She and her partner have their eyes on the Kia Niro and Chevrolet Bolt as possible alternatives. ‚ÄúAs consumers, our power is what we buy. I think younger generations in particular vote with their wallets, and I feel like that might come back to bite.‚Äù

For much of the past decade, Tesla lacked competitors that matched its models‚Äô battery range and other measures of performance. Consumers put off by Musk‚Äôs mischief had few EVs to turn to. As legacy automakers introduce more capable electric models, Tesla won‚Äôt have as much leeway.

‚ÄúWe've seen among the early adopters more of a willingness to take risks or to put up with things that are out of the ordinary,‚Äù says Dovorany, who left Escalent for an automotive tech startup earlier this year. ‚ÄúWe're not seeing that as much with incoming buyers.‚Äù To win this cohort, automakers need to check every box, and for some, that includes employing a CEO who doesn‚Äôt share Hilter memes on social media.

Levitt, the self-described former Musk fanboy, took a test ride last month in a Lucid. He wasn‚Äôt sold on it, partly he says because it didn‚Äôt have enough cargo space for his golf gear. He‚Äôs still waiting for another automaker to steal him away from Tesla and considering models from Audi, Mercedes and BMW.

‚ÄúIf you take Mr. Musk and his antics out of the equation, I'm about 98% certain that my next car would be a Tesla,‚Äù Levitt says. ‚ÄúHis antics put me in play.‚Äù"

Snapchat, its an app all of us (atleast i hope) have herd about or used before ... you know to send nudes and get sneaky links and shit like that . Well  right now at a very strong level of support which is around the 45 dollar mark . Also its about had enough downside as it really cant stay below 45 for much long before rallying from 44-45 back to around 54 bucks where it has strong resistance . Furthermore it has a gap to fill from 77 bucks . It fell due to a miss on its revenue by ... 3 million dollars . WTF instead of making 1.10 billion dollars they made 1.07 billion dollars which is a miss but for it to drop instantly 22% after that is kind of retarded to be honest .

 Revenue increased 57% to $1,067 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.

* Net loss improved 64% to $(72) million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Adjusted EBITDA improved 209% to $174 million in Q3 2021, compared to the prior year.
* Operating cash flow was $72 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(55) million in the prior year.
* Free Cash Flow was $52 million in Q3 2021, compared to $(70) million in the prior year.

Its about 44% from its all time high of 80 bucks so its in a good buy zone . Earnings were good just a loss of 3 million from expected revenue is what set it down and with apples privacy updates. But i think it will make up for that apple privacy bs with the meta verse as the years go on , dont forget yall all those snap chat filters and etc are essentially  augmented reality and snap is still investing heavily in  augmented reality .

TLDR-  Snap is primed to the tits , its 44%ish off its ath, apples privacy changes fucked it but metaverse and new users make up for it, it has a gap to fill from 58 to 77 bucks .

Disclaimer- I do own a few calls on snap , its had a lot of nice swings both to the upside and downside

1632075967.0,Ebay undervalued," 

Ebay is a e commerce website that allows people to find just about anything they are looking for on their global marketplace aka [ebay.com](https://ebay.com/) . Their platform helps connect millions of buyers and seller all over the world on a daily biases.

**WSB TLDR- Its basically like amazon,etsy,etc**

So whats up with them?

Well, they are undervalued . They have been beating earnings for the last few quarters and are in a very competitive field that will not go away any time soon.

E commerce showed just how big it was thanks to covid. A lot of companies revamped their e commerce portion such as how walmart target and bunch of retail companies allowing people to have curb side pick up ( they come to the parking lot and a store associate goes and drops off their groceries . Doordash and other food delivery services helping save a lot of businesses by allowing people to buy and get food when restaurants couldn't have people come and sit and eat. Etc.. And the biggest example... fucking amazon , the king itself , has crushed earnings with 3 quarters striking over 100 billion dollars in revenue . This e commerce wave was already coming , but covid helped speed it up .

Furthermore since 2020 .. well earlier but ima start from 2020 they started selling off parts of their business to the other companies that specialize in that certain niche. For instance

"" eBay in November agreed to sell its ticketing unit, StubHub, for $4.05 billion to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd. ""(cnbc) **This is old.**

They also sold ebay korea to this huge korean retail gaint that says this will help improve their e commerce portion , while ebay still holds 20% stake.

**TLDR- Ebay is selling off parts of its company that isnt bringing in enough revenue to A cut costs , B gain cash/ value in the long run because they still hold a stake , C making themselves more competitive by focusing on their main revenue streams.**

SUPER IMPORTANT-

Furthermore, Ebay made it official that they will be dropping Paypal effectively allowing Ebay to manage the transactions themselves which means more money for ebay . They will do this by using Adyen, a payments which already has deals with netflix uber and a few other big tech compaines, thus effectively meaning more money for ebay since they are cutting out the middle man.

Ebay these last 4 quarters has been crushing earnings with beat after beat on revenue and eps with the last quarter bringing in 2.67billion vs the expected 2.63 and an eps of .99 vs .96 .

BIG CATALYST

Guess what, its that time of the year again when ebay will perform amazing the fall holiday season is already here with retail stores already getting the candy and shitty spooky theme . Ebay has always performed amazing every time around this time of the year.

I see right now as the time to buy since it isnt priced in yet... here let me say it like this .

Homedepot, lowes and a bunch of other compaines started gaining a lot of value from may , june, july leading up and into hurricane season . Thus when the hurricane came IT WAS ALREADY PRICED IN. Furthermore , most stocks last week including ebay tested out a support line.

Right now , ebay is trading at around 74 bucks which in undervalued

Here price targets are calculated-

Price target = (Stock price / Foward pe )x Current PE

The current pe is the trailing pe

stock price - it closed last friday at 74.11

Forward pe is 17.3

current is 22.59

the pt is about 96.7 as of now for the end of the year

Now granted other factors do matter this the price target gets changed around such as how supply chains have effected the market, covid, competitors but so far ebay has been managing itself and is slowly growing each and every year.

TLDR- Ebay is undervalued asf , its been crushing earnings each quarter, and is about to run up due to the holiday season coming

1612694779.0,but what if we try to invest in GOPRO? (GPRO),"Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down 18.6% as of 3:30 p.m. EST. 

The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period. 

So what
Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019. 

Now what
Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $44.4 million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $66.8 million for the year. 

GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said GoPro.com generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.

Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period. 

GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around.

While this has been happening intel has been smoothly bringing in nearly 100 billion $ in revenue.

Yeah Intel is not flashy and is currently suffering from its lack of memeticness but it is an absolute titan in the biggest most valuable industry in the world. Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.

Guess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.

Literally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.

Most of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.

Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.

I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.

Im long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.

PS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial. I guess some things never change.

1664086173.0,NFTs are the Pyramid and Ponzi Schemes of Our Generation,"I know the ""no cryptocurrency"" rule but NFTs are only bought with cryptocurrency, but they, by themselves, are not cryptocurrency, so I'm hoping to avoid the mods deleting this post, but I can see why they would (I tried to post on r/CryptoCurrency but I'm simply too young and unwise as a Redditor).

&#x200B;

A pro-NFT argument I always see is, ""It's just like buying valuable paintings,"" I have never understood how anyone can make this argument and present it as being anything but ridiculous.

A real painting can easily be verified. Let's say you bought the Mona Lisa, which is worth almost $900 million. You would have the exact canvas that Leonardo da Vinci used and the exact brush strokes he made. If I were to take a photo of the painting and print it out, I would not have that canvas nor the brush strokes. Even if I could perfectly draw the Mona Lisa, it would not be verified by anyone as genuine because it does not have the exact features of the canvas and brush strokes. We do not yet have the technology to perfectly clone the centuries of aging and all the small imperfections that come with it.

On the other hand, NFTs are unverifiable. If I were to take a screenshot or click, ""Save image,"" I would have the exact same pixels, the exact same picture, and the exact same NFT. There are no special pixels that only you have. I have everything that you have in the exact same way that you have it. And unless I explicitly say that I ""stole"" it, you have no way of proving that the NFT is yours and not 100% mine, there is no proof of purchase, no receipt, no logs of money exchanged, nothing.

Credit/debit cards and cash can be tracked, but cryptocurrency cannot. The people selling NFTs can easily give you a copy of an NFT they already have, and you cannot do anything about it. There are no receipts, everything is the seller's word against yours.

NFTs have become the Pyramid and Ponzi schemes of this generation. They are worthless pixels paraded around as valuable pieces of art to sucker people into buying them, the people who fall for the scheme end up regretting it and having to sell it to make the money back, so they sucker someone else into paying for it and then they sucker someone else into buying it, creating a cycle of scams started by the original maker and seller of the NFT. It is a game of online hot potato where you toss the NFT around until someone is absolutely unable to sell it.",wallstreetbets,"NFTs are the Pyramid and Ponzi Schemes of Our Generation I know the ""no cryptocurrency"" rule but NFTs are only bought with cryptocurrency, but they, by themselves, are not cryptocurrency, so I'm hoping to avoid the mods deleting this post, but I can see why they would (I tried to post on r/CryptoCurrency but I'm simply too young and unwise as a Redditor).

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever seen a company so shorted at such a low share price before. Ticker FOMC has already acquired multiple companies and is about to acquire a 50 million dollar company (Smartguard Energy) at the end of the month. 

What‚Äôs it‚Äôs market cap after it acquires all the companies including the 50 million? Well right now it‚Äôs 53 million. How is that possible? Well because it‚Äôs obviously not priced in yet.

Now you‚Äôre thinking, well this is too obvious isn‚Äôt it? Don‚Äôt overthink it. It‚Äôs because they used to be a zero bid stock before the new CEO Vikram Grover took over 2 years ago. There isn‚Äôt much confidence yet and it‚Äôs a volatile investment.

1668270657.0,Are Stocks Starting to Become Severely Undervalued?,"Hey everyone,

I was thinking that it might be a good time to start looking for opportunities in the market. I see you guys posting some serious gains a lot of the time and wanted to know what everyone thinks. I was reading an article this morning about META being at a historically low price in terms of value. I just want to know, do you guys think its time to start looking to deploy capital into some of these great stocks that are down 80-90%? Or do you think that things will keep on falling.

I'm making this post to try and have a ""civil"" discussion on where we think the overall market is headed in the near term. Lets say one years time. Is it too early to start looking for these potential great opportunities in the market or is the time now. I know last week the inflation report came out lower then expected, but Its still very high compared to the historic average. That got me wondering if it was just a rally because we havent seen any form of good news in so long that even half good half bad news is enough to cause a significant rally? Anyways when im talking about opportunities, im referring to stuff like they outlined in this article I read this morning, basically it was showing that some stocks are at ridiculously low levels compared to value. The example used was META, its trading at the same price as in 2015 but now its doing $27B in revenue compared to $4B and the EPS in like 5X or 6X higher. I can drop the link to the article I guess, but im really here to discuss the future of the market. Also do you guys think the points brought up about META in the article make sense?

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

üö®üö®50 TOMORROW üö®üö®

üö®üö®60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.üö®üö®

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

üö®üö®50 TOMORROW üö®üö®

üö®üö®60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.üö®üö®

THIS IS NOT A üßªüëêTRADE

&#x200B;

Not financial advice. I don't know anything.

Positions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.

I will be purchasing OTM calls tomorrow at open üöÄüöÄ

Based on the $200 million estimate of *The Little Mermaid*‚Äôs budget, the Disney movie needs to make at least $500 million at the box office in order to be a success. The general rule of thumb is for a movie to earn back at least 2.5 times its budget, so if *The Little Mermaid*‚Äôs box office comes in between $500-625 million, then Disney‚Äôs latest live-action remake will have been victorious.

How am I making money in this scenario? I'm selling $45 weekly put contracts. What does that mean? I'm betting that the price of GME will not go below $45 by the time the contract expires (Mar-5). If it does and the contract is executed, I'm obligated to purchase 100 shares at the strike price of $45. Why did I pick $45 strike? That's a price I am comfortable purchasing 100 shares at. That's a price I can afford to purchase shares at. That's a price I am happy to purchase shares at. There are a few key resistances above $45.

1686700891.0,I have an idea but I'm not sure how to execute.,"So in the in-between time of betting on earnings, I need something else to occupy my mind and I came up with this:

A bunch of companies pay dividends, right? And when they pay out those divvies, the money comes from the actual company shares, right? So when they pay the divvies, the share price should drop (at least in the short term) right?

What I want to be able to do is figure out the price the stock will be when the dividends are paid out and buy puts around that point.

Or should I buy calls, betting on the idea that most people who hold dividend stocks are just reinvesting the divvies back into the ticker?

I've come up with what I think would be the ""formula"" for figuring out what the price would be if shareholders all took the divvies out and dropped the price, but it seems too simple to be correct.",wallstreetbets,"I have an idea but I'm not sure how to execute.

1619791383.0,MVIS is bargain of the century right now,"So let me get this straight. 

Royalties this year are expected to be $3.3 million for 2021 (virtually double the 2020 royalties) thanks to the $22 billion contract between Microsoft and the US army. S2upid smashed up a Hololens to prove MVIS tech was in it and MVIS confirmed it was their part in S2upids video during their meeting May 2020.

We also now have back on the table the rumoured $100million deal with Sharp who have just had a 12 month extension granted to their exclusivity deal for MVIS tech for a display/smart speaker etc.

We then have the value of 484 patents as of last year, which has no doubt increased in number since then.

We also have the disruptive best in class A sample LIDAR produced this month, which beats anything from  anyone else hands down.  A bidding war feels imminent on this, unless a deal has already been agreed privately subject to maybe one more milestone of them testing it themselves first...

And then add on the other products that they are working on. 

I‚Äôm amazed this hasn‚Äôt gone higher in share price! It definitely feels like it will be a 3 figure stock for the buy out. 

It just shows how much power the hedge funds have when they short, to drag the price down so low. I thought they might have learned a lesson from GME but clearly not!",wallstreetbets,"MVIS is bargain of the century right now So let me get this straight.

1646555754.0,"I took out a loan after 10 years of debt free, but for a good reason, hear me out","Back in 2010, i declare a bankruptcy after a business failure due to partner betray. I got into debt and cant afford to pay it back. After bankruptcy, i tell myself i will never take out anymore loan. I will only risk with the cash i have onhand.

It is until i join wsb, that i start see thing in different way. You see, even if i dont have debt, i still gonna be affect with how crock this market is, and how jpow keep printing money.  My money will shrink in value infront of this monster inflation.

At first, i was wonder what should i do even if i take out the loan, where can i put my money that will bring value and profit? Where is the safe haven? 

You guess it right, i will put my loan into GME. You may say im retarded, but im not stupid. I did the math

Currently Target raise their employee salary to $24/hr, while california minimum rate is $15/hr.  In-n-out near me hiring for $21/hr.  Restaurant that i use to eat hiring for $19/hr for waiter.  If i take out $1000 loan, with my previous wage of $15/hr, it will need 66.66 hours to pay off my debt. But if i switch to any of these job, i can pay off my debt within 53 hrs just by flipping burger at in-n-out.

And with inflation keep going up, gas price go above $5 per gallon, food price go up by 30%, interest rate from bank raise by 0.5%+, cost of commodities go up by double, govt and company will have to raise our salary rate or no one else will able to shop anymore. When no one able to shop, that is when great depression come in. 

As such, i gladly took out a loan, knowing 
1. I will able to pay it off easier in future. 
2. I find a safe haven for my loan, where i know my ceo, chairman will not sell their share, where i know i will not get betrayed again. 
3. I will thank myself in future for take a loan today. 


I break my principle of no debt, because i rather get in debt with my own hand than with hedgie's hand.  I walk into debt with my own than being put into debt because of jpow. 


As for why i put it into GME, i dont want to explain it, i will recommend you to watch ""gaming wall st"" on HBO, and watch John Stewart on Apple+ tv.


-----------------

Edit: how do i post my position for proof? I Cant attach a picture, should i make another post for position?

2nd. Why i take loan instead of save it up? Because the speed i can earn and save are slower than speed of inflation. If i can make a big enough loan to buy a house last year in california, it will be up by $200k as of now. How the fuk can i make $200k in 1 year just by working...

3rd. Why gme instead of gold, metal, etc... Not because of HBO movie alone, i been buying since last year, i officially have long position on it. It just the movie give me more confidence that gme will moon. The movie explain it is pretty much impossible Melvin get out of position beside ""transfer"" their position to someone else with bigger wallet to play.

As for why i put it into GME, i dont want to explain it, i will recommend you to watch ""gaming wall st"" on HBO, and watch John Stewart on Apple+ tv.


-----------------

Edit: how do i post my position for proof? I Cant attach a picture, should i make another post for position?

2nd. Why i take loan instead of save it up? Because the speed i can earn and save are slower than speed of inflation. If i can make a big enough loan to buy a house last year in california, it will be up by $200k as of now. How the fuk can i make $200k in 1 year just by working...

3rd. Why gme instead of gold, metal, etc... Not because of HBO movie alone, i been buying since last year, i officially have long position on it. It just the movie give me more confidence that gme will moon. The movie explain it is pretty much impossible Melvin get out of position beside ""transfer"" their position to someone else with bigger wallet to play. Aka shitadel."

I had the bad experience of buying an AMD GPU that was not compatible with Tensorflow from Google since Nvdia has partnered with them. This is a gross negative since the GPU graphic had the same benchmarks as Nvidia.

All of the graphs comparing 2008 to 2022 look similar... but as you know the final nail in the coffin in that 2008 crash was the reports of banks needing to be bailed out.

Haven't heard much on WSB about the freezing cold hitting the US these next weeks so I wanted to point out a strategy with retard level returns. About half the homes in the use [natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/images/whf_longformat_0132018.pdf) to heat their home and the other half uses electricity, but guess [what the majority of electricity generated in the US is with natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20was%20the%20largest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25) at 38%. Most people are ignoring it because of the green stock push, but the only green is dollar bills :D Starting tomorrow and in the upcoming weeks its going to get extremely [cold](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/814day/index.php).

Why does this matter? Supply and Demand baby production has not recovered from its its drop last year and is not expected to return to normal until [2022](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46476). This means that production is not replenishing storage as fast as other years. Right now there is a small surplus in working storage if weather holds (hence the long term trade) that surplus will be a deficit by Feb 19. At that point working storage is going to be 2000 BCF.  Here is the kicker there working storage can't go lower than 1000 Bcf of gas because there needs to be natural gas in the pipelines for them to work. The closer it gets to this number there, the price of natgas is going to shoot up!! Officially working storage does not stop getting emptied until the 2nd week of April meaning there is going be 8 weeks of withdraws.

The best part is that there will always be a buyer for natural gas!! Utilities will always need to buy  natural gas for electrical generation. Right now they are in denial and just keep wishing that the problem goes away. But just ask [Japanese utilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/asian-spot-lng-price-hits-record-on-cold-winter-supply-crunch) what happens when storage starts to run low!!!

**Why buy now** its cheap right now, most traders are waiting for winter to verify and the utilities are hoping that it never happens. Of course you should only be trying this if you can afford to.

$UNG is the ETF that tracks natural gas and will start going to the moon the lower the storage goes.

There are also many natural gas producers that will benefit with the rise of the price. This is especially true if management takes advantage of the price move and locks in prices for the rest of the year (they have the ability to do that) .

Because this is WSB I found the Natural gas producer with the largest short percentage at 16%. That would be RRC

For those of you that want to follow the [natural gas storage numbers](https://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) (updated every Thursday at 10:30 ET)

**TLDR:** If you can afford to buy UNG now because its gonna get really cold in the US for the next three weeks. If you want to go full retard and attempt a short squeeze RRC is your best bet with 16% of its volume float at 16%.

1584706289.0,PUT on NVST (Envista) JUN $9 strike,"**TLDR: PUT NVST JUN/SEPT  $9 Strike**

Envista owns 30 dental brands and sells solely dental equipment and consumables.

1. Dentists have all been lock-downed in Europe and US. (70% of revenues). Nobody is going to be buying dental consumables or new dental equipment.
2. Even if dentists were to resume operations in July, consumer confidence will be quite badly affected. How many consumers are going to purchase $8k braces in a recession?
3. Yes, stock has gone down 60%. However, there is **high risk of bankruptcy.**

* Envista was spun out of Danaher in Sept 2019. Before spinning Envista out, parent company loaded it with a shit ton of debt ($1.3 billion).
* Envista has only $20m of cash in US. There is $200m of cash on balance sheet, however, $180m is held in foreign countries such as China, with heavy withdrawal restrictions.
* The $1.3b of debt has very strict covenants including a Debt to EBITDA of 3.75 to 1. Failing which, the whole amount of $1.3b immediately comes due. Currently their Debt to EBITDA is 3.1 ($1.3b of debt; last 4 quarters EBITDA up to Dec 2019 of $420.7m). **With just 1 loss-making quarter,** likely 2020 Q2, their DEBT to EBITDA will spiral to 4 or more, triggering **$1.3b of debt due immediately**. At that point, no bank in their right mind will loan $1.3b to a company in such bad situation.

Sales:¬† They sold $3.5 billion in Q1 2021 of the Covid-19 vaccine, with an estimate of $26 billion for the whole year 2021.¬†   


https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-revenue/

Earnings:  Pfizer reports earnings in 7-28.¬† Do you think covid has gotten better  or worse since the last report?¬† Do you think it will last beyond 2021  or not?¬†   


Dividend:¬† For those that  actually like money, they just declared a dividend of $.39 per share  payable to those holding on July 30th.¬† So you can both gain from  hopefully a good earnings report, and the dividend.

This is not financial advice, do your own research before investing.¬†   


But I've gone big on PFE, in for 1,000 shares.

this will probably get buried but i feel the need to write it

Disclaimer: I AM NOT ACTIVELY INVESTED IN $GME $AMC ET CETERA. NOR DO I HAVE CONTRACTS.

Let us Begin.

I have been lurking on this sub for 7 years and some change. Most of you are probably too new here to remember DryShips (wow what a time), AMD when it was 8 dollars, the Marijuana craze, or the many other notable time periods on here. These past few weeks have been incredible to watch, not in a positive or negative way, truly here to watch the madness.

I hope you all make money whatever the play. Money grows on trees in this economic climate. Go get some, but don't let the ladder fall.

Lots of anger here today, blaming institutions, blaming individuals, blaming the lizard overlordz for your losses. Listen, I get it, no one LIKES to lose money.

Markets have not been rational for a few years... So I ask, where was this anger when Yield Curves inverted and the vix has been through the roof for the last couple years? whats that? your account was green? oh ok then. I say that not to disparage but rather to inform the subreddit as a whole that you guys have blinders on that hide what you do not want to see (confirmation bias).

What we DO NOT need is for congress to swoop in and save the day. only thing that type of intervention brings is the common man holding a bag that that causes you to lose sleep. Robinhood was wrong to suspend trading. but it was completely legal. they are a company that has to make money. (If something is free that is not free anywhere else, then it is most definitely NOT free, as you all saw today)

People are trading as they drive down the interstate. we have never seen this before on such a massive scale. but remember, the market will always REMIND you of your mortality. it may not be today, or tomorrow or even next week, but the market will humble even the very best.

This does end the way you want it to end. no one will go to jail. corporations come out on top. remember that. it's a beautiful thing for some but a depressing thought for others. But it is the way humans have operated for millennia. **the smaller tribe always got defeated and beheaded and raped by the larger powerful tribe.**

GOOD LUCK TO ALL, YOU BEAUTIFUL MOTHERFUCKING RETARDS!!!

Would that satisfy the strikers!? Let's say every executive that makes North of $10 million/year pledges to donate $1 million to their fund. Will they quit crying and go back to work? Probably not.

No, Mr. Damon needs to take a pay cut of at least 30%. As well as every other overpaid actor. That's what they expect the executives to do! So put your money where your mouth is! It's going to take more than just cutting the executive pay scale to make a dent. You're talking about wanting to give tens of thousands of people a significant raise.

Giving 50k people a $10k/year raise will cost $500 million/year. In addition to what they already make. So explain to me how Bob Iger's $26 million/year pay is going to cover that $500 million/year expense? I'll wait...

Better yet, instead of cutting Matt Damon's pay, I don't EVER want to see him again! Or Chris Pratt, Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lawrence, etc. Stop paying them ridiculous amounts of money and give the roles to lesser known actors. Give them a chance to come up. Deal!?

For those who are not aware, there is a chaotic situation in South Africa right now which is only continuing to get worse, and some believe that South Africa may soon become a failed state.

Commodities expert Rick Rule has been consistently saying for years that any chaos in South Africa would quickly lead to soaring platinum prices. Here is a recent interview where he says it:

""The demand-side for the platinum-group elements is very much intact. The supply side is what's curious. Most of the PGEs in the world come from three countries. South Africa--not the model of stability. Zimbabwe--almost not a country. And Russia--which of the three is a paragon of stability. But if you were to experience social and political disruption in any of those markets, you would see markedly tightened PGE supplies, and I would argue higher prices.

If you shut down production in any of the markets I described--I expect you'd see a price-explosion. I'm not saying that South Africa, Russia, or Zimbabwe is going to blow up. I'm just saying that the production of this element is constrained to countries that are---well, let's just say it isn't Western Australia.""

[https://youtu.be/xeIorlppdaI?t=755](https://youtu.be/xeIorlppdaI?t=755)

On another occasion, Rule wrote: ""The utility of platinum is so extraordinary. The amount of platinum that it takes to deliver the air quality that we enjoy today relative to the cost of the vehicle that that platinum enables the sale of is incredible. At today‚Äôs platinum prices, it takes about a $100 or $125 worth of platinum in catalytic converter to sell a $40,000 car. Were the price of platinum to double, it wouldn‚Äôt impact the price of the vehicle whatsoever.""

In the Asian countries, like Japan and Korea, platinum is also considered a precious metal rather than an industrial one. It was briefly used as money in Russia in the 1820s and 30s. Investment demand for physical platinum, however, matches just one-tenth the value of silver investing each year, and less than 1% of investors' demand to buy gold. This implies that monetary supply is extremely scarce.

There is also a massive platinum short position on the COMEX, even bigger than the one on gold. What happens if we get a default, like what happened to palladium a few years ago?

The posts from this morning when it jumped to 85$ and so many more people fomoed in and now trading at sub 60 is fucking comedic gold. I don't understand why people were listening to accounts that have been posting here for less than 3 weeks when every account that's been here longer were telling you to get out or open puts. 

Your greed has gotten you to where you are now. I hope you learn from this and go into the future with a better understanding of the world. 

No, you're not sticking it to Melvin or the hedge funds. There are over 1,700 hedge funds with a billion+ in capital.

1624034781.0,Canoo ($GOEV): Buy puts on this EV manufacturer ahead of 116mm share lock-up expiration (+100% of float) on Monday (6/21)," \*\*\*UPDATE: BOUGHT PUTS ON FRIDAY AND CLOSED OUT THE POSITION TODAY FOR 20% GAIN. THANKS FOR PLAYING.

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

* Massive share lock-up expiration on Monday (+100% of float)
* Insiders able to dump 116mm shares into the market (vs. 99mm float & 4.7mm ADV)
* Company is under SEC investigation
* Opaque Chinese-based backers (Pak Tam Li & Remarkable Views)
* Significant self-dealing by management ($541k paid to aircraft company controlled by CEO)
* Shares jumped by +16% on Wednesday following a good Reddit DD post by ny92 ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0bhqk/canoo_goev_the_ev_manufacturer_thats_ready_to/))
* **How to trade this thing: Buy $GOEV puts (with 6/25 expiration @ $10.00 strike)**

**COMPANY OVERVIEW**

**Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV)** is a $2.4bn market capitalization Los Angeles-based EV subscription start-up which intends to manufacture electric vehicles. The company was co-founded by ex-Faraday Future employee Stefan Krause, who stepped away as CEO in August for [personal reasons](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20807575/canoo-ceo-leave-temporary-stefan-krause-startup-ev-designs-car-subscription). Mr. Tony Aquila has since taken over as CEO. The primary goal of Canoo‚Äôs vehicles is autonomous operation.

**SHARE LOCK-UP EXPIRATION**

**On Monday (6/21), insiders will be able to sell 116.2mm shares** in the open market. This lock-up represents **117% of the company‚Äôs current float** (99mm share float). Given the significant issues the company faces (incl. the pending SEC investigation), it is **very likely insiders will head for the exits**.

Insiders such as **Chinese-based Pak Tam Li (79.5mm shares)** and **Remarkable Views (39.8mm shares)** will be able to sell their shares in the open market. The management team, including **CEO Tony Aquila (12.4mm)** will also be able to sell. **The 50-day average volume is 4.7mm shares (\~$48mm ADV at current prices), which will make it difficult for the share price to absorb significant insider selling**.

Trade setup for spy  today

** Spy continues to be dead locked between 320 and 324, but an interesting thing to notice is that we are making higher lows in this range**


Even tho spy is stuck in this range it is hinting an upward direction as dips are being sharply bought, spy on this range is behaving like an accumulation zone for new positions for August series

#personal bias is spy will trade between 320 - 325 i.e. yesterdays range and may prove to be a volatile day due to the upcoming data and earnings




#____________________


**Longterm** :  indexes are not showing any clear indication for upward momentum but they are trading fairly well after the initial rally, indexes all over the world are somewhat in a accumulation zone.

**Random tip for the day** : "" market falls when there is uncertainty not when there is bad news  ""

Trade setup for spy  today

** Spy continues to be dead locked between 320 and 324, but an interesting thing to notice is that we are making higher lows in this range**


Even tho spy is stuck in this range it is hinting an upward direction as dips are being sharply bought, spy on this range is behaving like an accumulation zone for new positions for August series

#personal bias is spy will trade between 320 - 325 i.e. yesterdays range and may prove to be a volatile day due to the upcoming data and earnings




#____________________


**Longterm** :  indexes are not showing any clear indication for upward momentum but they are trading fairly well after the initial rally, indexes all over the world are somewhat in a accumulation zone.

**Random tip for the day** : "" market falls when there is uncertainty not when there is bad news  ""

1661977061.0,Strategic Update: I lost 50k in BBBY and its your fault,"Stop and think. This is your fault. Anyone reading this now, YOU are the cause of my misfortune. I‚Äôve been mislead time and time again. At first the sub was flooded with ‚Äúfactual‚Äù posts that Ryan Cohen can‚Äôt sell. While they were removed, these posts tricked me into buying. 

Further posts suggesting Cohen wouldn‚Äôt sell tricked me into buying even more. Then the stock tanked. I panic sold, whatever. 

But the price started rocketing again. People began trying to trick me back into buying. They said the strategic update was bullish. They said buybuybaby would be spun off. They lied. They are bag holders who tricked me into holding their bag. To anyone who witnessed these posts, which in hindsight were wrong, YOU are also in the wrong. 

Silent bystanders have been responsible for tragedies throughout the ages. The holocaust happened because bystanders stood by. The same goes for MY loses. You did nothing while I was tricked into putting my life savings into bbby. 

Now further trickery is occurring and I refuse to be a bystander. People are saying bbby is on the Reg SHO w/ high short interest. Thus, a short squeeze will occur. This is more trickery. Most stocks on the Reg SHO list never have a short squeeze. Bbby momentum is dying, sentiment is at a low point (this post is living proof. You need millions buying for a squeeze to occur. Nobody will buy when sour bag holders like me keep crying that they lost everything. 

I am a piece of shit fuck head pussy. I paper handed at $9.15 with a 50k loss. And you thought I had a well reasoned post? Of course not. It‚Äôs all emotion. If you want money you need to stop being a pussy like me and buy more. Fuck it I think I might buy more.

1650232697.0,Elon Musk wont succeed in buying Twitter: short Twitter via may 13 44 puts,"Sorry for clickbait title, nothing against Musk but he cannot succeed in buying out Twitter. Twitter will remain a public company, that status quo will continue as it has been. Republicans/conservatives will downvote me into oblivion, cry and whine about free speech blah blah, but feelings =/= facts.

Thesis: The takeover attempt of Twitter will fail completely, whether its through a complete buyout, or or a proxy war over the board. Furthermore, there will not be any other entities that are willing to offer an alternative buyout (that twitter will accept). As a result, the Twitter stock price will plummet back down to 30s before Musk began buying shares. Puts are the winning strategy.

Argument 1: Poison Pill (shareholder rights plan) will make it nearly impossible for Musk or a consortium to gain control over the board. The moment Musk or a consortium reaches 15% ownership of the company, all other shareholders will have the right to buy discounted shares of Twitter. The result is that the acquiring group will constantly have their shares diluted, and the entire attempt will become exorbitantly expensive. Indeed, poison pills are very effective at preventing even the attempt of a hostile takeover.

Argument 2: Musk's 54.20 buyout offer is too cheap. Companies of this size generally don't consider any offer lower than their 52 week high. Twitter has hired Goldman Sachs to advise them in this matter; apparently Goldman Sachs believes that the offer is too low to be considered. Additionally, the decision by Twitter to adopt a poison pill almost surely implied that Twitter also believes the offer is too low. They will not accept a bid of 54.20. To entice the board to sell the company, Musk and Co, or some other firm will need to offer a significantly higher premium, a lot closer to the 52 week high of \~$70.

Argument 3: In theory, Musk probably could afford to buy Twitter at a price the board cannot refuse, but is he willing to do so? Musk doesn't have enough liquid assets to do this immediately, he would have to liquidate the equivalent of his entire stake in SpaceX to come up with \~45 billion dollars. To put it another way, is Musk willing to give up SpaceX to buy Twitter? My guess, is probably not. The fact that Musk is already talking about getting \*other\* people on board with him suggests that he is unable to, or not willing to foot the bill.

Conclusion: Twitter will not be bought out by Musk. Therefore, the logical thing to happen is for Twitter to fall back down to the 30s.

Disclaimer:

My position: Holding May 13 $44 strike puts, worth approximately 1000 dollars. If I had more money I'd invest more. Screenshots are proof of my position.

In a couple years most of the OEMs will be featuring siriusxm similar to terrestrial radio.  I will not be surprised if the dealers will be offering siriusxm radio for 3 to 5 years as a standard part of the transaction.  

Let it make it clear.  I am not advocating sirius xm as a service but rather as a Business whose $1.668 B fcf in 2020 is 8 more than spotify's and probably more than all streamers combined.  For some reason, most folks associate the company with siriusxm radio only.  This was the case five years ago, and a huge mistake to think now.  Today, siriusxm owns Pandora, is the leading digital ads technology  thanks to AdsWizz and Simplecast, that just surpassed 1 B monthly downloads, owns about 15% of SoundCloud, and 100% of Stitcher, on of the top 4 podcasts in the country.  I expect the share price to double already this year with Q1 to be a blowout quarter.

Yes, the Recession is canceled. There may be drops along the way, but nothing like what people are hoping for and nothing like the massive sudden 30% drop we originally faced. In the end stocks will rise. 

Any factors that you think will drop the economy are priced in. If you, some retard, knows these things, the experts know it too and more! 

This is not comparable to 2008 and corporate debt isn‚Äôt that big a deal. Most of the retards who have been calling for a big drop don‚Äôt know what the fuck they are talking about. There are no housing bubbles and shit. While I also have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about, there is one big difference between me and the other retards. I am right and they are WRONG as evidence by the massive market pump.

Also, now that WSB is bullish it does NOT mean to inverse. The people buying calls are the ones inversing WSB because WSB has been saying for weeks that there will be a big drop. I am the one inversing bitch! The fact that this post is getting so much hate shows that I am still inversing WSB. Thank god I am liberated from my autistic positions inspired by gay WSB bears.

Here‚Äôs where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.

On the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.

If the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.  

Once the merger happens those who have üíéüëê‚Äôs will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.

1590261820.0,(DD) LULU - Lululemon and why you should not buy puts,"I have seen way too many comments and posts asking why Lululemon, a company which focuses on fitness apparel for women is skyrocketing and is reaching ATHs. I'm here to explain to you that LULU is actually one of the strongest apparel companies/retailers on the market.

&#x200B;

**Company summary:**

Lululemon is a company that focuses primarily on selling fitness attire for women. They also make some stuff for children and men, but their primary demographic are women who are willing to spend $50+ per item. If you aren't a virgin, then you've probably heard of them or Gymshark, their main (private owned) competitor. If you aren't aware that it's popular, just know there's a subreddit for their products where a bunch of women show off their new overpriced leggings, sports bras, and over sized ""boyfriend t shirts"" (yes that is the name of a product)

&#x200B;

**Financials:**

I know most autists here don't believe in financials or fundamentals, but let me tell you why LULU is blowing your mind why it keeps going up --- and most likely will keep going up leading to earnings. The big boys do still target a price point for these stocks so it's important to at least acknowledge them while riding the wave up or down. Their last earnings call was Q4 2019 which ended Jan 2020 where they had record sales.

**Income:**

\-Revenue increased from 916.1M in Q3 2019 to 1.4B in Q4 2019.

\-Revenue from online sales increased by 38% from 2018-2019.

\-Revenue from online sales accounted for 28.6% of sales in FY 2019

\-Q4 2019 - $462.2m EBITDA - 33.07% margin on sales.

&#x200B;

Summary: LULU already had a reliable online sales portal. Based on the earnings reports of other retailers and apparel companies, there was a correlation between online sales viability and having a minimal impact from the stay at home lifestyle. They don't need megastores or giant mall space to earn their money and in fact have the highest sales per squarefoot of any company. Thanks to the extremely high markup on their goods they also have impressive margins.

&#x200B;

**Balance Sheet:**

**-Cash & cash equivalents ending Q4 (End of Feb) was 1,093.5 million aka over $1B in cash/liquid treasury bonds**

**-NO LONG TERM DEBT**

\-Lease expenses are estimated to be $152M for all of 2020.

\-They have a revolving credit account for $392M, but given current cash stores it is unlikely to be needed.

&#x200B;

**Other notes:**

\-LULU's main factories are based in China and SE Asia. Let's be honest, China is going to shove their people back into the factories faster than Trump will and they will be working over time ---- On a realistic note, it's unlikely that logistics will be an issue. Company already had 540M worth of finished goods in inventory going into Q1 2020 so unless we face a second lockdown it is unlikely their supply lines will face long term disruptions.

\-Their target demographic is likely not very price sensitive. If your girl wasn't dropping over a hundred for a Tuesday morning workout outfit, before COVID, she wasn't a target.  Since they market to women they can charge a premium. Would a man pay $80 for some gym shorts? No, but you can be sure a chick wearing leggings sure will.

\-Most clothing companies have a problem of seasonality. Fitness / leisurewear normally is an all year round item as people wear it both at home or when working out. There is a possibility it might see an overall increase if the work at home becomes a more permanent fixture in life.

&#x200B;

**EPS projections:**

Currently the consensus on EPS is sitting at .25-.29 EPS.

This is terribly off as it assumes that Q1 spanning from February to April would only have a NI $32M\~ w/ 130.3M shares outstanding. Even if they only managed to sale half of their worst quarter in 2019 (96.6M in Q2 2019) they would still exceed that. Given that physical stores stayed open through February and half of March and that online sales shot up for everyone throughout March/April I think it's fair to assume they will far exceed expectations.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As of now, the stock sits at $277. Since I am usually a bear I think it would be wrong to over estimate things, however I won't fight the trend and reality that they're in a better spot than 90% of other retailers. I think it will fluctuate between 285-290 but if people here think it's going to moon to $300++ I think that might be too optimistic. However, I have come to believe in the power of the Fed so I wouldn't be surprised. I would be very cautious about holding past earnings or thinking it will explode much more but I think there's still room for it to cap out at.

&#x200B;

Position (Bought 2 weeks ago): 6/12c 265",wallstreetbets,"(DD) LULU - Lululemon and why you should not buy puts I have seen way too many comments and posts asking why Lululemon, a company which focuses on fitness apparel for women is skyrocketing and is reaching ATHs. I'm here to explain to you that LULU is actually one of the strongest apparel companies/retailers on the market.

&#x200B;

**Company summary:**

Lululemon is a company that focuses primarily on selling fitness attire for women. They also make some stuff for children and men, but their primary demographic are women who are willing to spend $50+ per item. If you aren't a virgin, then you've probably heard of them or Gymshark, their main (private owned) competitor. If you aren't aware that it's popular, just know there's a subreddit for their products where a bunch of women show off their new overpriced leggings, sports bras, and over sized ""boyfriend t shirts"" (yes that is the name of a product)

&#x200B;

**Financials:**

I know most autists here don't believe in financials or fundamentals, but let me tell you why LULU is blowing your mind why it keeps going up --- and most likely will keep going up leading to earnings. The big boys do still target a price point for these stocks so it's important to at least acknowledge them while riding the wave up or down. Their last earnings call was Q4 2019 which ended Jan 2020 where they had record sales.

**Income:**

\-Revenue increased from 916.1M in Q3 2019 to 1.4B in Q4 2019.

\-Revenue from online sales increased by 38% from 2018-2019.

\-Revenue from online sales accounted for 28.6% of sales in FY 2019

\-Q4 2019 - $462.2m EBITDA - 33.07% margin on sales.

&#x200B;

Summary: LULU already had a reliable online sales portal. Based on the earnings reports of other retailers and apparel companies, there was a correlation between online sales viability and having a minimal impact from the stay at home lifestyle. They don't need megastores or giant mall space to earn their money and in fact have the highest sales per squarefoot of any company. Thanks to the extremely high markup on their goods they also have impressive margins.

&#x200B;

**Balance Sheet:**

**-Cash & cash equivalents ending Q4 (End of Feb) was 1,093.5 million aka over $1B in cash/liquid treasury bonds**

**-NO LONG TERM DEBT**

\-Lease expenses are estimated to be $152M for all of 2020.

\-They have a revolving credit account for $392M, but given current cash stores it is unlikely to be needed.

1613351762.0,Why you should buy $COTY this week. Worth $10 to $30 depending on time horizon. Mentioned on Barrons as buy. Michael Burry may own calls too!,"I own $COTY stock and calls and I think you should too. Stock is a value play with many catalysts. Target $10 to $30 depending in time horizon.

Here is why I bought 500 contracts of $COTY Calls for Feb 19th $7 strike, almost 5% of Open interest. 

A bit of background first so you can understand the reasoning why I am pretty much all in on calls. Can post pic of my account below for proof. Please do your own due diligence. I have read all of the coty annual reports for the past few years, transcripts, interviews, 8k filings, i even walked to their headquarters in Amsterdam to see if it was open during the pandemic. So, when i make a bet I do a lot of research. 

I used to work at a hedge fund and one of the reasons why I quit was because I realized I was helping rich get richer. I then moved to Asia and lived there for over 8 years. I learned a lot over there and one thing I saw was how asians love brands and can be addicted to them regardless of quality, although that has changed a bit. Makeup and skincare is popular everywhere and Asians are increasing their usage of perfume too, they did not as much 10 to 15 years ago. 

Coty is the number 1 company in the world when it comes to selling perfume or fragrances. They own their own brands but also own licenses to a lot of other brands.

Covergirl
Kylie cosmetics and Kylieskin
KKW (Kim kardashian)
Burberry (license)
Gucci (license)
Adidas (license) 

Wella (40%) which includes OPI and a lot of stuff many women use at beauty salon and buy at Sally beauty supply, Walgreens etc. 

Over 60 brands which i actually think is too many which is exactly what the new ceo is going to fix. Less brands but more revenues per brand. 

There is a new ceo who was a major boss for L‚ÄôOreal for 20 years and then started her own skincare brand and after 3 years basically was acquihired to join Coty. This is the best decision ever made as the stock went from $30 to $3 on shitty management that did a lot of financial engineering and big deals that ended up costing shareholders a lot.

So, here are the catalyst as to why the february numbers are going to be outstanding. 

The company has added new distributors in europe, in fact one of the largest, that they did not have before.

13% of their sales were online or direct, that will be 20% or more this quarter which improves the top and bottom line. 

Added new team for China, which was badly needed. In fact, made a marketing deal with a top Chinese celeb and within a few hours sold out of the product they were promoting. 

New products are being launched in skincare category. 

Shitty brands are going to be sold which raises cash for the business. 

More aggressive expansion of skincare products which is going to be a faster part of the business that WallStreet is not modeling. 

I can show you why below

Revenue breakdown by product as of the last quarter was the following:
55.8% Fragrance
30.% Color cosmetics
0.3%  Hair
13.7% Skin and Beauty

Geography 
42% USA and Latin America
47% EMEA (Europe)
11% Asia Pacific

If you compare to L‚ÄôOreal which is $200 billion market cap vs. $5 Billion for Coty. 
40% Skincare
21% Haircare
18% Makeup
11% Fragrances
11% Hygiene products

Geography
42% Asia Pacific
24% North America
18% Western Europe
8% Latin America
6% Eastern Europe
3% Africa, Middle East

If you compare these businesses you can see how these are night and day. 
Asia growth is anemic for Coty at 123 mm last quarter and will be the fastest segment of the business for the next 5 years, I expect it can  grow 30% or more a year and be larger than the Americas segment. Thu is because there was little exposure given the lack of offerings in the Skincare. 

Also, beauty products are consumed more frequently than a fragrance. A perfume can last someone a month or 6 months where as a skincare product can last 1 month or maybe 2. It consists of consistent purchases which brings consistent revenues and cash flow to the business something the business needs to improve upon. 

Company has a lot of debt but have paid of $3 billion and will keep paying jt off given the higher profitability. 2.5 billion was from sale of 60% of Wella and $1 was a direct investment from KKr via a convertible bond at $6.24 conversion price. 

Stock is 65% owned by insiders and there js not a lot of shares out there to buy. So, although no squeeze there is definitely scarcity of shares.

Kylie cosmetics and kylieskin have been growing steadily since their international expansion. Ranking as the 22,500 website in the world.  Both Kylie and Kim will help them grow the cosmetics, fragrance and skincare  via a DTC offering. Those businesses by themselves are like MINI Coty‚Äôs as they can sell a lot of stuff under their brand. 

I think the comany will do 20 to 30 cents a share in earnings, wallstreet estimates are 10 to 20 and are all stuck at $6.5 price targets, except Citi which is at $10, she believes turn around is real this time. Stock is still below pre-covid price and can easily go to $10 to $15 on the turnaround taking shape.

Wallstreet is sleeping on this one. I contacted one of the top retail stock analysts, she is on cnbc a lot, and her firm does not cover the stock due to lack of institutional interest. Have LinkedIn messages to prove this but do not want to out her for business reasons. 

This is where the community can come in and buy shares today at $6.90 or options and sell them to the institutions at $15 or higher when they realize what they missed.  

I own the stock and the options. The stock I purchased at $3.33 and still hold and the option I purchased months ago as I felt that WallStreet and main street would catch on to the story but Wells Fargo put out a piece that was quite negative, they are in denial of the turnaround, and has forced consolidation of the stock for months. The reason why I picked the $7 strike js because at the time they were in the money and felt it was a safer bet than say $8 or $10 longer dated calls which started to become too expensive for the risk/reward offered.  

I own 400 contracts cost of .785 per contract with strike of $7 with February 19th as expiration. 

UPDATE 1/29/2020
I have added to my stock position from 12,500 shares to 30,000 shares and added 100 more contracts for a total of 500. 


I feel confident they will do well short-term and long-term when you see the increased growth of online traffic for all their brands online ever since they started selling directly. 

I have so much more info but I can post it in the comments.

I have also been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, but am able to manage it effectively with marijuana and delta-8.  I am able to take my paychecks from my jobs at CVS and Amazon Fulfillment center and fund my weed and delta 8 medication (I live in a state where it is not medicinal or recreationally legal) by trading on RobinHood. However I made some bad trades recently and lost most of my money. 

That said I am YOLO‚Äôing my entire account on PSTH. And here‚Äôs why, I rely on my cousin to loan me money to keep my weed/delta 8 inventory supplied, and he is getting a MBA at a top school right now and is recruiting investment banking for Sponsors groups.  He told me that he was having a call with a person at one of those big banks that‚Äôs not Goldman Sachs, and that that group told him they had met with Bumble and Bill Ackman recently.  It just now occurred to me that that was a PSTH de-SPAC meeting and Ackman is assessing them as a target.  Stripe is off Bumble is on.  This would go right in line with Bill Ackman‚Äôs woke empowerment angle.  

I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense as a long-term play, but it would definitely pop in the short term if it were announced.  Blackstone could be looking to monetize on its investment last year.

In the past, as many boomers will attest, USA was a country of sacrifice. Millions of young people gave their lives in WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Korean War, Gulf War, Afghanistan, & Iraq. And in the earlier wars, Americans sacrificed. They didn't ask for handouts. But now, at the first sign of trouble everybody has their hand out. How the hell did this happen?
I'm all for lending a hand but why are corporations asking for handouts? Large corporations don't deserve handouts especially the ones who have out-sourced American jobs, screwed over Americans in every which way, don't pay taxes by hiding profits through off-shore tax shelters, moved HQs to foreign countries to get out of paying taxes, utilized every loophole to follow the letter of the law instead of the intent, or have already started to let people go even though they make 100M in profits. I'm writing about large corporations, not the small businesses which are dying because of the large corporations.

One of the things that the govt did yesterday by agreeing to pay monies to regular people, I think, is to say, ""hey we gave you money so we're going to give money to the airlines, casinos, cruise operators, theaters, media companies, etc."" They are giving people $2000. That might seem like a lot of money but if you think about it, it's not alot. It's enough for just a month and this virus is not going away in a month.

We know unemployment is going up, twitter ""laid off"", and people will be desperate which leads to desperate actions...Is it possible that shit can really hit the fan?

Is that why CEOs are ultra rich individuals are looking to get out of the USA?

All we have are clunky immobile headsets that let us into a clearly artificial world. There's no real value to that. The novelty wears off quite quickly once you realize the limitations and how cumbersome it is.

But, once VR reaches the point of full realism, including haptic feedback realism, it will be the inevitable future. Imagine lying down in a pod and being transported into whatever world you can imagine. Millions of people would line up to escape the bullshit that is their real life. 

Not only that, the possibilities become endless. You could escape night, and only live in the day, or vice versa, for example.

Imagine VR brothels. No risk of infection or anything else, and conceivably you could bang literally anyone you wanted as many times as you wanted.

The Meta verse makes perfect sense as the future for most people. There won't be much left to do once AI is in charge of most tasks. The technology just needs to catch up.

Go to work. Come home. Bust a meta nut. Bedtime. Repeat. 

Right now, we're just stuck with groping VR cartoon pandas.

1. Nobody said this is happening tomorrow or that you should load up on meta stock and calls. I thought it was implied and clear that the technology is very far away. But as usual, short sighted apes gonna read into what I wrote.

2. The whole point is that the headsets are useless, which is why the meta verse seems useless. The technology is currently unattractive, but that doesn't mean the actual virtual universe isn't where the world is heading. So if your problem is the headset, then you're agreeing with me.

1644588750.0,What most people are forgetting about fed rate rises vs. inflation,"There seems to be a lot of people here that seem to think that fed won't raise the interest rates to fight inflation at the risk of the economy / markets tanking (ala what they have been doing for the past 3 decades). 

Yes, based on past precedent for the last 3 decades, we've seen the fed being super accommodative to the stock markets with interest rate decisions, having kept them at historic lows at the fear of having stocks or property go down. 

But inflation is a complete different beast to what fed has been fighting all these past years (i.e., keeping property / stocks high for the top echelon elites by sacrificing wealth equality and peasants). 

Inflation is something that the top richest and most powerful elites of this world fear more than anything. 

Why? Because it erodes their wealth. Taking the Rothschild family for example (with an estimated net worth of $400bn). You really think they aren't freaking the fk out if inflation suddenly zooms and turns their $400bn into the price of a big mac??

NO. This is why the feds will raise interest rates substantially to fight inflation. Their priority has always been for the top echelon of society and they will do damn anything to keep that power structure in balance even if it means tanking the global economy.

1619108686.0,Telos (TLS) DD," **Trash my DD:** This is my first DD, so by all means trash it, give me pointers, degrade me, etc I'm here to learn! I've seen a couple people a few months back lightly cover this company but without details. So, here's my take.

&#x200B;

***TELOS***

&#x200B;

**What is it?** An I.T. and cyber-security company that serves govt and large enterprise clients and focuses on leveraging cloud technology.

End of 2020, going into ‚Äò21, Telos switched their focus to product development, scaling, and deliveries. They didn‚Äôt have any strong advertising or marketing strategies ending 2020, though they plan to drastically change that this year with a planned *300%* increase on revenue from their 2020 advertising/marketing investments.

Their biggest product, Xacta, is used by BIG names: ***CIA, DoD, National Archives, Department of Energy, Amazon, and Microsoft.***

Telos has been flying under the radar for the past few years, being used only by people like the CIA, because they‚Äôve wanted to focus on a niche customer-base and provide quality service, building up their business through hard work and a loyal, federal customer base rather than hype-- another reason you won‚Äôt find out too much information on them through typical analyst ratings: they‚Äôve had a completely different customer-niche than usual companies. As they begin to spread into commercial organizations, more data will be released for the public to analyze.

Now, as cyber-security becomes increasingly important, institutions are setting standards that security and I.T. companies have to comply with. These organizations outside of federal agencies are constantly seeking help to comply with these new sets of standards which Telos has mastered with their cybersecurity product, Xacta. Telos is the only player in the game with a product like Xacta. All eyes are turning to them for help with complying to these new standards. Roughly 50% of commercial organizations are set to adopt these standards this year, with Telos‚Äô product Xacta. Commercial companies/organizations everywhere are starting to do their research on who can help operationalize these standards and soon beginning to find out that Telos is the top dog in the game for it.   

The next venture of domination for Telos seems to be the educational sector. Unleash: ***Telos Ghost***. The Ghost product actually aims to completely hide the school‚Äôs network and cyber infrastructure from any outside or even internal threats as well as simply unauthorized users. Another goal of Ghost will be to completely prevent cyber bullying and hide the students and their assets, digitally speaking (very interested to see how the prevention of cyber bullying will be implemented into the security framework). Not only will Telos conceal the students and the school‚Äôs digital infrastructure with Ghost, working with Telos helps with school audits, making the exhaustive process smoother and within compliance with security standards. As we mentioned before not many products, dareisay‚Ä¶. Any at all‚Ä¶ offer full security to organizations within the new set of security standards. Another factor that Telos has is the wifi networks they offer to educational institutions. It offers massive collaborative capabilities to the students and teachers, helping everyone achieve their goals together on the go with peace of mind of any security breaches on mobile networks. 

Looking at Telos as a stock, as of 4/19/21, institutional ownership has risen .1% to 27.6% and insider ownership has risen *16.3%* to 26.6%. They‚Äôre closest competitor is CSP Inc. which ended last year on a negative 1.45 million in net revenue, whereas Telos has actually ended 2020 with a net gain of 6.84 million. They only plan to increase their net revenue this year with the marketing and advertising investments they‚Äôve made. The net gain of 6.84 million is up from last year‚Äôs negative 2.3 million and up from prior years as a whole, showing healthy signs of growth. Their revenue growth has gone up 20 million consecutively each year the past two years. Towards the end of 2020, Telos also signed a 10 year, 10 Billion dollar plan with TSA and their pre-check system. Coming into 2021, they‚Äôve even managed to go ahead and set up $75 million in deals with customers *so far*. They still have plenty of time to add a couple more deals in. Their revenue for the end of the year is projected to be between 283 million and 295 million, which is over a 50% increase in revenue compared to last fiscal year.  Their earnings are projected to grow over 60% this year-- that‚Äôs faster and higher than the u.s. stock market as a whole year to year. The return on equity for the next 3 years is predicted to be almost 30% (29.3%). Telos also has NO debt. The company actually just completed a ‚ÄúFollow-On Offering,‚Äù which is a great thing for Telos because all they were doing was simply raising capital shortly after having their IPO-- a completely healthy move, in fact, a very bullish sign (remember, they have no debt, so all it did was give them more money to work with for future projects).

These organizations outside of federal agencies are constantly seeking help to comply with these new sets of standards which Telos has mastered with their cybersecurity product, Xacta. Telos is the only player in the game with a product like Xacta. All eyes are turning to them for help with complying to these new standards. Roughly 50% of commercial organizations are set to adopt these standards this year, with Telos‚Äô product Xacta. Commercial companies/organizations everywhere are starting to do their research on who can help operationalize these standards and soon beginning to find out that Telos is the top dog in the game for it.   

The next venture of domination for Telos seems to be the educational sector. Unleash: ***Telos Ghost***. The Ghost product actually aims to completely hide the school‚Äôs network and cyber infrastructure from any outside or even internal threats as well as simply unauthorized users. Another goal of Ghost will be to completely prevent cyber bullying and hide the students and their assets, digitally speaking (very interested to see how the prevention of cyber bullying will be implemented into the security framework). Not only will Telos conceal the students and the school‚Äôs digital infrastructure with Ghost, working with Telos helps with school audits, making the exhaustive process smoother and within compliance with security standards. As we mentioned before not many products, dareisay‚Ä¶. Any at all‚Ä¶ offer full security to organizations within the new set of security standards. Another factor that Telos has is the wifi networks they offer to educational institutions. It offers massive collaborative capabilities to the students and teachers, helping everyone achieve their goals together on the go with peace of mind of any security breaches on mobile networks. 

Looking at Telos as a stock, as of 4/19/21, institutional ownership has risen .1% to 27.6% and insider ownership has risen *16.3%* to 26.6%. They‚Äôre closest competitor is CSP Inc. which ended last year on a negative 1.45 million in net revenue, whereas Telos has actually ended 2020 with a net gain of 6.84 million. They only plan to increase their net revenue this year with the marketing and advertising investments they‚Äôve made. The net gain of 6.84 million is up from last year‚Äôs negative 2.3 million and up from prior years as a whole, showing healthy signs of growth. Their revenue growth has gone up 20 million consecutively each year the past two years. Towards the end of 2020, Telos also signed a 10 year, 10 Billion dollar plan with TSA and their pre-check system. Coming into 2021, they‚Äôve even managed to go ahead and set up $75 million in deals with customers *so far*. They still have plenty of time to add a couple more deals in. Their revenue for the end of the year is projected to be between 283 million and 295 million, which is over a 50% increase in revenue compared to last fiscal year.  Their earnings are projected to grow over 60% this year-- that‚Äôs faster and higher than the u.s. stock market as a whole year to year. The return on equity for the next 3 years is predicted to be almost 30% (29.3%). Telos also has NO debt. The company actually just completed a ‚ÄúFollow-On Offering,‚Äù which is a great thing for Telos because all they were doing was simply raising capital shortly after having their IPO-- a completely healthy move, in fact, a very bullish sign (remember, they have no debt, so all it did was give them more money to work with for future projects).

1. Trump is proclaiming that the governor to White House relationship is a two way street. And they need to do something for him, setting up these tense exchanges and media war. If they openly express anger towards him, he may withhold aid.

2. All these hard hit areas are deep blue areas. NYC, Illinois, California. Cities, portrayed as the elite.

3. He will also falsely ‚Äúorder‚Äù the country back to work and proclaim the virus defeated when it is not. Leading to more anger and outrage.

4. The federal government response thus far has been  extremely lacking.

We will be much worse than any country we‚Äôve seen so far. Worse than Italy. I‚Äôll get to more of why that is.

5. NYC is extremely dense. The subways are packed each morning, flu season often strikes many people in an office at once, everyone is physically much closer to each other.

&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can‚Äôt trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we.

1612234985.0,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as ‚Äúreset transactions,‚Äù in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm‚Äôs responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

We all just got screwed by Robinhood's screwup here. I'm friends with a lawyer who says we have a good case for a class action lawsuit.

&#x200B;

Everyone comment here if you have/had shares or calls in GME held in Robinhood at market open today.

&#x200B;

Let's show these guys the system can't fuck with us!

&#x200B;

Edit:

Everyone take screenshots of Robinhood's app saying you can't buy, or blocking your orders.

Edit the 2nd:

Wheeeew lads let's get on it! I'll go through all these pms and comments this afternoon with my lawyer friend. Keep em coming!

And please share!

Edit 3:

OMFG guys I'm getting 1000s of PMs! It'll take a while to sort through them all and reply, but keep messaging and sharing! Also if you were using WeBull or some other brokerage and got blocked, you might as well join too.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Edit 4:

My team and the lawyers had a conference call, and it's on!

We'll have an update in the next 48 hours with the procedures and next steps.

If you have any questions or concerns, please PM me and I'll try to get through as many as I can once we have more details.

Edit 1/30:

Work is ongoing. Sorry for the lack of news, the lawyers are still getting their ducks in a row. I'll update with more info as soon as it's available.

2/2 Update:

Just to let everyone know where we're at, my team is currently doing the research and building the case. This is a pretty huge lift though, so we're getting people on the team with the expertise needed to give us the best chance of success. It's taking time to get the most qualified people possible, but I want to do this the right way. I hope to have another update with good news in the near future. Thanks for all of the support and encouragement!

PS, sorry guys but I literally can't open my Chats now. Probably has something to do with the 8.9k next to it.... If you need to reach me you can send a Message, or leave a comment and tag my username.

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can‚Äôt know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON‚ÄôT COVER.¬†
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can‚Äôt circumvent it.
They‚Äôre bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That‚Äôs why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it‚Äôs not.

We also know they‚Äôre down BAD. Why?
Because they‚Äôre attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let‚Äôs see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It‚Äôs only effective if we would sell.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Just look at the volume. People are not selling:

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There‚Äôs tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)

Now let‚Äôs get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don‚Äôt seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)¬†
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.¬†
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pushing this narrative in the media.¬†

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that‚Äôs just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN‚ÄôT ‚ÄúREDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY‚Äú.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let‚Äôs see to what extend they fucked up exactly:¬†

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it‚Äôs NOT about the price, it‚Äôs about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That‚Äôs why they want you to sell so bad.**

ü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíéü§öüèºüíé

Last but not least I‚Äôm holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I‚Äôm holding because I hope to see a better future and I‚Äôm holding for all you out there. 
To the Moon or zero.

Disclaimer: 
This is not financial advice, I‚Äôm literally an ape. I just like the stock. Do your own DD and avoid the fake new and/or resurrected accounts here and the manipulative Media.

Edit: wanted to post a few new posts but it seems like I‚Äôm shadow banned. No one can see my posts. 
I don‚Äôt know if I got caught in some kind of spam filter.

Now let‚Äôs get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don‚Äôt seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)¬†
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.¬†
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pushing this narrative in the media.¬†

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that‚Äôs just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN‚ÄôT ‚ÄúREDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY‚Äú.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let‚Äôs see to what extend they fucked up exactly:¬†

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it‚Äôs NOT about the price, it‚Äôs about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That‚Äôs why they want you to sell so bad.**

1611951445.0,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here‚Äôs a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let‚Äôs get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can‚Äôt afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There‚Äôs a catch. You need enough money (please don‚Äôt use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",wallstreetbets,"How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. 

BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO

Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG

Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla. Look to your left, now look to your right, these are your brethren and sisterthren who will diamond hands with you until we all pass down these tendies to our children's children. Onward."

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

1611874779.0,30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb,"I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.

Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

It's important to know/remember this now, because the same person that got exiled for being a tyrant is doing a media circus, trying to ride the current spotlight for personal gain, again. Hey CNN and WSJ, stop interviewing that dipshit. The sub has always been about its people, and what you guys wanted to do (as retarded as you are). No single person speaks for the sub and controls its destiny. It is in good hands with u/zjz aka u/SwineFluPandemic

Edit: He is spreading complete lies about the sub and the mods that got him removed:

>	Despite being its founder, Rogozinski was kicked out of the forum in April for trying to eliminate the hate speech plaguing the community.

>‚ÄúThere were a handful of mods who were straight up white supremacists,‚Äù he said.

>‚ÄúI have really thick skin and people can say whatever they want to me, but at some point there‚Äôs a moral standpoint ‚Äî like with my kids, I don‚Äôt want them to think, ‚ÄòWell, they can say whatever they want about you,‚Äô‚Äù he told the paper."

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way.

However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)‚Äîor 125% (25 √∑ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling.

1612216701.0,15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight),"Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

No credit necessary",wallstreetbets,"15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight) Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

I am trying to catch the message ‚Äì so don‚Äôt expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it‚Äôs entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don‚Äôt trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World ‚Äì let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don‚Äôt wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of ‚Äûthis is over‚Äú, ‚Äûwe missed the squeeze‚Äú, ‚ÄûI am going to loose it all‚Äú, ‚Äûentered at 320$ - I am doomed‚Äú. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET ‚Äì yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! ‚Äì and follow DD posted by people with names like ‚ÄûSHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS‚Äú? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry ‚ÄûOne-Wish-comes-true‚Äú show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn‚Äôt exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don‚Äôt trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments ‚Äì this is about ‚Äûget rich or die trying!‚Äú. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this ‚ÄûSaudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts ‚Äì but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now ‚Äì could be though the next big thing ‚Äì got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET ‚Äì the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize ‚Äì you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn‚Äôt do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? üòì**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It‚Äôs a fucking global movement now (or not ‚Äì could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have üôåüíéand the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy ‚Äì we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven‚Äôt understand the concept or how this works ‚Äì speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up ‚Äì desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors ‚Äì shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious ‚Äì you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let‚Äôs be fucking honest ‚Äì most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody ‚Äì I even don‚Äôt remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it ‚Äì we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That‚Äôs it. If we are right ‚Äì this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock ‚Äì do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought ‚Äì hmmmm makes sense ‚Äì I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don‚Äôt want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) ‚Äì no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the üöÄ is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please ‚Äì no post without üôåüíéüôåüíéüôåüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ and if you want to fukn leave the party ‚Äì leave ‚Äì but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I‚Äôd rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  ‚Äì I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have üôåüíé

Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy ‚Äì we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven‚Äôt understand the concept or how this works ‚Äì speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up ‚Äì desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors ‚Äì shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious ‚Äì you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let‚Äôs be fucking honest ‚Äì most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody ‚Äì I even don‚Äôt remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it ‚Äì we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That‚Äôs it. If we are right ‚Äì this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock ‚Äì do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought ‚Äì hmmmm makes sense ‚Äì I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don‚Äôt want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) ‚Äì no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the üöÄ is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please ‚Äì no post without üôåüíéüôåüíéüôåüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ and if you want to fukn leave the party ‚Äì leave ‚Äì but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I‚Äôd rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  ‚Äì I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have üôåüíé 

Edit: Nobody asked for it but 35@231,69 and thanks for the awards which should go to u/knutolee \- so you can simply award his original post referenced. More importantly he expressed to me that he is very happy with the translation which is almost as important as the message itself.

Edit 2: Please pay attention to AMA Marc Cuban - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey\_everyone\_its\_mark\_cuban\_jumping\_on\_to\_do\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/) \- there is I think some quite enlighting answers in a very easy to understand language.

Edit 3: Bought 5@103 

Edit 4: Heading for dinner. Crazy times. Will check later and decide whether to buy more tickets or not. But maybe good advice for some others to make a break. Chillax :)

Edit 5: Read that RH has opened up GME again. For whatever it's worth üöÄ

Edit 6: Thanks again for all the Awards and stuff. I can only reload in the morning. Was fun and maybe I am going to translate more in the future - if mods would consider to give me a copy cat üò∫ flair it would be the icing on the cake.

Edit 7: Obligatory salute to the one and only DFV and his üíé balls. This guy will go all the way to the üöÄ with us."

He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]",wallstreetbets,"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this: There's a rich kid in town.

Below is a time capsule of what you missed out on in 2020! Ah, feels like it was yesterday...

Well, with the economy currently collapsing, it's only going to get more interesting going forward!

Hop into the daily discussion thread (at the top of r/wallstreetbets/hot), have some fun and stick around!

Over the past few days, this subreddit has seen an absolutely insane amount of growth. In the past week, subscribers have quadrupled, pageviews have surpassed 1 BILLION, and the potential financial gains are unlimited!

We wanted to take a moment and teach all the newcomers what wallstreetbets is all about.

Wallstreetbets is a place of high risk, high reward, trades. Some are well thought out... but not usually.

#**We've got [losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

There was the guy who [bought gourd futures and lost everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/), the guy who [turned a $5,000 investment into a $58,000 loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/), the guy who [put everything on the Argentinian peso, hours before it collapsed](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpcao5/the_guy_that_called_argentina_to_tank_was_right/eworkdq/), the guy who [had to take physical delivery of oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e3e5/i_bought_oil_at_32_yesterday_and_made_26000_sort/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamjdk) and [""GUH"" which is a video you just need to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/).

#**We've got general craziness!**

Like when [we found the ""infinite money cheat code"" on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drt5tr/guh_of_fame_2019/), forcing [Robinhood to post to WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4r0sy/robinhood_statement_on_options_collateral_and/) and push an update disabling options, we had [the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/), regularly posting, livestreaming, and even becoming a moderator. We've got [Mr. Beast investing $100,000 in whatever the top comment said to invest in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hrorfa/i_will_invest_100000_into_whatever_is_the_top/). We've got [Pokimane, asking what to invest in and becoming a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f75eod/thank_you_for_giving_me_moderator/) and subsequently crashing the market in March.

So if you have an insane trade idea, **post it here**! We look forward to roasting you like we did u/deepfuckingvalue when he posted about GameStop in 2019. He's worth 8 (9?) figures now, so who knows, maybe you'll be next?

What you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money. 

For those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use [some ""colorful"" language](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fr21/basic_guide_to_wallstreetbets_culture_for). Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. 

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.

JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping.

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

&#x200B;

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ‚úÖ

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

Edit:  I have a super super small position in GME, like 3 shares.  I have been on WSB since like 2014.  Trust me.  I am NOT a bag-holding whiner.  I take my losses like a fucking champ.  (MSFT 240C, USO, PRPL, SLV in 2020, etc) I am also NOT promoting any sort of holding, buying, or selling any of your positions.",wallstreetbets,"The SEC Just posted the new numbers for Failure to Deliver. Guess What, GME is failing to deliver every day. Hey 'Tards,

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

&#x200B;

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

Edit: Obviously none of this was financial advice anyway but seriously NONE of this is financial advice I'm just a retard on the internet and if you listen to me for it maybe you're also retarded

1. Reddit mods can apply for paid-internships at Reddit. This is much closer to having a real job than what they currently do and would benefit the organization.
2. Your flair is your official title at the company. IE: instead of ""CFO"" you'll be ""PotatoFart""
3. NSFW posts will receive special protections--and if you happen to work in our new skyscraper then NSFW posts are automatically considered SFW.
4. Everyone gets a turn in the corporate jet.
5. Elon becomes a mod. He can also apply to become a paid intern.
6. We have a monthly party on our company yacht: *The S.S. VisualMod*.
7. Our corporate cafeteria is a dining hall with fast food restaurants along the side--but they're all Wendy's.

Keep it high and tight.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs.

My father was 57 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn't a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. 

After a divorce from my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. 

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 3 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to. 

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would've loved this cause and would've rallied with us till the end.

I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes. 

We love you dad. Thank you for believing in us.

Edit: 
1.)Thank you to everyone who has left me their condolences. Believe it or not, I attribute a lot of my ability to move past some of this because of your support. I don't have a great relationship with a lot of other members of my family, and my girlfriend has been great at supporting me through this as well. 

2.) Thank you for all the upvotes, even if you didn't leave a comment. I don't really care about the karma (as I pointed out to a few rude people here), but seeing that so many of you got to read the thread and appreciated my dad the way I did REALLY means a lot.

Also want to point out that I have been taking all of the coins I got from the awards (That I ALSO didn't really care to receive but they manifested nonetheless) and giving out awards to members of this subreddit for all of their devotion to the cause.

3.)

To anyone who has not gone through this process before I would advise you to have the hard conversation with your parents and ask them what their final wishes are. While my father ( dubbed ""poppawallstreetbets"" by another user here) didn't really have much in that department I believe we have put together an arrangement he would be happy with. We will be having him cremated(which at least that part WAS vocalized), flying out to his home town in Carpenteria, California, and having his Ashes spread along the pacific ocean where he spent his younger years surfing before injuring himself. I have done my best to invite as many of his friends and family as I can. But for anyone in the immediate area, I invite you to attend as we finalize more of the details over the next 2-3 months.

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

I've been neglecting sleep and insufflating copious amounts of Colombian blow just so I can remain symbiotically attached to every shred of current market data I could find about GME and its current trajectory. 

So, I'm basically an expert at this point (and so is my cousin who used to work for a NASA contractor in Cocoa Beach, Florida). 

This basically puts me on par with that Cramer guy or whatever. 

Anyway, here's a snapshot of where we stand today:

[A concerning uppy\/downy thing for some, but a harbinger of extreme, stratospheric ascension for the better-informed among us](https://preview.redd.it/vhlskfppfif61.jpg?width=966&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7426badc70e80e2ef9e342b4a2bcd622b40b704)

&#x200B;

Now, I want to draw your attention to to the dimensions of a three-sided polygon (aka triangle) that I created by referencing a few points that seemed highly sus and therefore worth referencing.   


The result of my wizardry is thus:

Now, this is where shit gets interesting. 

I knew there was something uncanny about the shape of this triangle. I fucking knew that I'd seen this EXACT same triangle before in relation to advanced rocketry, but I wasn't sure where. 

So, I contacted my dealer, boofed another eight ball of the Devil's dandruff, and got to work meticulously pouring through all the available data until BAM. I found it.

But this situation is the first time I've felt like I have any sort of purpose since my wife passed away earlier this month.

All i have is one share, but thank you for letting me feel invigorated.  I don't have my livelihood riding on this.  But for the first time in a long while, I feel a fire inside me.  Thank you for this.

She always used to tease me for my obsessions with meme stocks, but I know she'd have loved to hear me rant about this bullshit in endless anti-establishment screeds.  I won't get to hear her laugh at me for it, but the least we can do is burn Melvin and Citadel to ashes.

She was stubborn as hell, and I hope everyone else here will join me in stubbornly refusing to sell.

EDIT 2:  You guys are amazing and generous and I've had a few people ask about donations they can make in her honor, or whether they can buy me shares or send me money or profits off the stock.  Please don't send me money, thankfully, medical bills are not an issue as she had excellent insurance until the end.   I will be ok financially, as well even if im still making adjustments.  If you wanted to fund shares for me, buy them for yourself, because we're all in this together.  I love this stock and i want everyone to have some! However, if you want to give, I've been directing people to give to the American Cancer Society.  If that's cool, awesome.  If you have another cause and this made you want to give, give to them instead.  I very much appreciate the sentiments though.

Now there's a significant chance they won't survive","Bringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive UI that any ape like us can use, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND!

However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits.

1613517868.0,"Welcome back, zjz.","Earlier today, Reddit Admins gave us the green light to bring back u/zjz to the mod team. It's hard to overstate how fantastic a development this is. 

Since the most recent mod shakeup, the entire team has been petitioning to bring zjz back. We wanted to keep you in the loop, but couldn't, because it might have hurt our chances of getting zjz back. We understand why this might have made you suspicious, but we're excited to put those suspicions to rest today.

Reddit Admins care deeply about the stability and continuity of the community, and so do we. At the end of the day, WSB is not defined by who is at the top of the mod list, it's defined by the conversations we create.

Even in the absence of zjz, we saw awesome discussions happening. Tons of great DDs, insane YOLOs, and beautiful, beautiful, gain and loss porn.

Now, with zjz back, we can take things even further. We can relax posting restrictions on account age and karma, which we use as proxies for post quality, and instead focus on the content of what's being said.

The truth is, I am very, very, optimistic about the future of WSB over the next 3-5 years. We have the absolute best mod team the subreddit has had since inception. Everyone who is part of a team now is someone that has played a big role of either the subreddit, or discord, community for years.

We appreciate your patience with us and the admins. We were all blindsided as we were thrown into this shakeup. No doubt mistakes were made at the beginning, but we're getting better every day to bring you the WSB you probably don't deserve.

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

1612310873.0,SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?,"*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  


  
First off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.

https://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

&#x200B;

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

https://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a

&#x200B;

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\_representation\_of\_a\_short\_ladder\_attack\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)
   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

https://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

&#x200B;

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

https://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a

&#x200B;

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\_representation\_of\_a\_short\_ladder\_attack\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)
   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

https://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on."

1611918713.0,Robinhood Is Lying - You Are Blocked Acquiring More Than 5 Total Shares,"Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. 

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say ‚ÄúWe reopened stock purchase of GME‚Äù and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here‚Äôs the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas ‚ÄúThe Shit Engine‚Äù Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it‚Äôs overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what‚Äôs overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here‚Äôs the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

No you don't need to report users for saying you probably do blowjobs behind the wendys.

If somebody says ""nobody tell him"" they are not being a dick you are just so fucking retarded because your question is probably basic shit you should know before investing.

# Surviving as a newcomer

Don't ask retarded questions that are basic such as:

* ""What is an option?""
* ""Should I buy X stock?""
* ""Is it too late?""
* ""What is IV?""
* ""Why can't I trade"" and the market is fucking closed
* ""What are futures?""

All this basic shit will piss off some degenerates because if you don't know any of this there is really no reason for you to be throwing 10k at weeklies you'll lose 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

Not only is it against the rules but nobody gives a fuck about your political thoughts. The only thing we care about on this sub is fucking gay bears and losing money. With this much people in a sub there is bound to be political commentary and I'd advise you to take it to a different sub.

They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

Stay wary and stay vigilant my comrades. This is a war of attrition.

1671512069.0,I Need Help! Robinhood says I need to deposit $4.4MILLION,"Okay, this all started when I was going to trade credit spreads on the $SPY last week. 

I started off with 32k. I was selling puts on DWAC for a couple weeks and that was gaining me about $500-$1000/wk. i then started selling puts on the SPY and realized I could do an iron condor and sell credit spreads on calls as well. I sold spreads $1 apart in strike and put up $100 in collateral for each iron condor chain. 

On Tuesday I had an iron condor which closed OTM on both sides but robinhood still closed my position for a loss of 9k before expiration (when I was due to collect all premium). I let this go, because I realized it was an oversight on my part to not realize robinhood would close them out. 

Wednesday, I made back 25k

Thursday, the s and p dropped and my spreads became deep ITM. At this point I was only selling put credit spreads, no longer doing iron condors. By end of day Thursday, my account dropped below 25k. I deposited an additional 10k

On Friday, I received a notification that because my account dropped below 25k Thursday, that my instant deposit limit was reduced from 25k to 10k.I started rolling my spreads from 12/16 to 12/23 for either a 0.0 credit or 0.2 debit. Mid way through this, they put a restriction on my account and did not let me trade until I closed out my 12/16 and accepted the loss of collateral, rather than roll the positions. I spent hours on chat support.

I sold my position. And cleared up the call.

Today, after market I received this email stating I need to deposit $4.4MILLION or close all my positions by 12/20 eod. When my deposit from last week, clears on their end 12/21. My app says I only am in a deficit of $776. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm in a deficit at all. All my positions are covered and nothing has been exercised.

I will any more information requested.",wallstreetbets,"I Need Help! Robinhood says I need to deposit $4.4MILLION Okay, this all started when I was going to trade credit spreads on the $SPY last week.
